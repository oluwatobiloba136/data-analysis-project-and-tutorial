title: "Data Science: Time for Professionalisation?"
author: Neil D. Lawrence
institute: Amazon Research Cambridge and University of Sheffield
abstract: "Machine learning methods and software are becoming widely deployed. But how are we sharing expertise about bottlenecks and pain points in deploying solutions. In terms of the practice of data science we seem to be at a similar point today as software engineering was in the early 1980s. Best practice is not widely understood or deployed. In this talk we will focus on two particular components of data science solutions. The preparation of data and the deployment of machine learning systems."
