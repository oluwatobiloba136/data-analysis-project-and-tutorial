title: "Probabilistic Dimensionality Reduction"
author: Neil D. Lawrence
institute: Amazon Research Cambridge and University of Sheffield
abstract: "When state spaces are large a useful approach to UQ would likely be to reduce dimension before analysis. In this talk, we review work on probabilistic dimensionality reduction using Gaussian processes. These ideas may be useful in reducing dimensionality as part of a wider analysis of a scientific system."
