## *Mathematical* Statistics

* 'Founded' by Karl Pearson (1857-1936)

## Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization

## Breadth vs Depth Paradox

* Able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the actions of individuals

* But less able to characterize society

* As we measure more, we understand less


## Examples

* Election polls (UK 2015 elections, EU referendum, US 2016 elections)

* Clinical trial and personalized medicine

* Social media memes

* Filter bubbles and echo chambers

## Solutions

* More classical statistics!

* A better characterization of human needs and flaws

## Quantifying the Value of Data

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!

## Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
  * Incentivization
  * Quantifying the value in their contribution

## Credit Allocation

* Direct work on data generates an enormous amount of 'value' in the data economy but this is unaccounted in the economy

* Hard because data is difficult to 'embody'

* Value of shared data: [Wellcome Trust 2010 Joint Statement](https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/sharing-research-data-improve-public-health-full-joint-statement-funders-health) (from the "Foggy Bottom" meeting)

## Solutions

* Encourage greater interaction between application domains and data scientists

* Encourage visualization of data

* Adoption of 'data readiness levels'

* Implications for incentivization schemes

## Privacy, Loss of Control and Marginalization

* Society is becoming harder to monitor

* Individual is becoming easier to monitor


## Free Will

*  What does it mean if a computer can predict our individual behavior better than we ourselves can?

## Discrimination

* Potential for explicit and implicit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality, health status

* All prohibited under European law, but can pass unawares, or be implicit


## Amelioration

* Work to ensure individual retains control of their own data
* We accept privacy in our real lives, need to accept it in our digital
* Control of persona and ability to project

## Awareness

* Need to increase awareness of the pitfalls among researchers
* Need to ensure that technological solutions are being delivered not merely for few (#FirstWorldProblems)
* Address a wider set of challenges that the greater part of the world's population is facing

## Conclusion

* Data science offers a great deal of promise
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**
