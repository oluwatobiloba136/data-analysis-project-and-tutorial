## Background

* Data is Pervasive phenomenon that affects all aspects of our activities
* Data diffusiveness is both a challenge and an opportunity

---

## Evolved Relationship

---

## Societal Effects

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data
* A requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface formulates the correct conclusions from the data

---

## Societal Effects

* This process has already revolutionised biology

* Shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data to indirect pathway between human and data via the computer

* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science

---

## Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization

---

## Measurement

* Able to quantify to a greater and greater degree the actions of individuals

* But less able to characterize society

* As we measure more, we understand less

---

## What?

* Perhaps  greater preponderance of data is making society itself more complex

* Therefore traditional approaches to measurement are failing

* Curate's egg of a society: it is only 'measured in parts'

---

## Examples

* 2015 UK election polls

* Clinical trial and personalized medicine

* Social media memes

* Filter bubbles and echo chambers

---

## Solutions

* More classical statistics!

* A better characterization of human needs and flaws

---

## Quantifying the Value of Data

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!

---

## Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
  * Incentivization
  * Quantifying the value in their contribution

---

## Credit Allocation

* Direct work on data generates an enormous amount of 'value' in the data economy but this is unaccounted in the economy

* Hard because data is difficult to 'embody'

---

## Solutions

* Encourage greater interaction between application domains and data scientists

* Encourage visualization of data

* Adoption of 'data readiness levels'

* Implications for incentivization schemes

---

### Privacy, Loss of Control and Marginalization

* Society is becoming harder to monitor

* Individual is becoming easier to monitor

---

### Hate Speech or Political Dissent?

* social media monitoring for 'hate speech' can be easily turned to political dissent monitoring

---

## Marketing

* can become more sinister when the target of the marketing is well understood and the (digital) environment of the target is also so well controlled


---

## Free Will

*  What does it mean if a computer can predict our individual behavior better than we ourselves can?

---

## Discrimination

* Potential for explicit and implicit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality, health status

* All prohibited under European law, but can pass unawares, or be implicit

---

## Marginalization

* Credit scoring, insurance, medical treatment
* What if certain sectors of society are under-represented in our aanalysis?
* What if Silicon Valley develops everything for us?

---

## Amelioration

* Work to ensure individual retains control of their own data
* We accept privacy in our real lives, need to accept it in our digital
* Control of persona and ability to project

---

## Awareness

* Need to increase awareness of the pitfalls among researchers
* Need to ensure that technological solutions are being delivered not merely for few (#FirstWorldProblems)
* Address a wider set of challenges that the greater part of the world's population is facing

---

## Conclusion

* Data science offers a great deal of promise
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them
