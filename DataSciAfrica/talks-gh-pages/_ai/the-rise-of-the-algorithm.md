\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/640px-Marcel_Renault_1903.jpg}{80%}

\speakernotes{Human brain like an F1 car, but an F1 car with bicycle wheels. We have a locked in intelligence.}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/Caleb_McDuff_WIX_Silence_Racing_livery.jpg}{90%}

\speakernotes{Computers are better balanced, they are lower powered, but because they have high bandwidth communication they can deploy all their power on the track.}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/George-peabody-library.jpg}{70%}

\speakernotes{Peabody Library, laid out for human access}

###

\includesvg{../slides/diagrams/data-science/hilbert-info-growth.svg}{80%}

\speakernotes{Large amount of digital data accessible to all}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/20160609_132315.jpg}{70%}

\speakernotes{1970 publication by Arthur Miller: The Assault on Privacy}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/20160609_132338.jpg}{70%}

\speakernotes{All been seen before.}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/ai/elephant-boy-poster.jpg}{40%}

\speakernotes{Pyschological models of intelligence: Dual process models of Cognition: Daniel Kahneman System One and System Two. Steve Peters, Our Inner Chimp. }

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/ai/the-new-revelation.jpg}{60%}

\speakernotes{Most people think of  intelligence as Sherlock Holmes like deduction. But actually what we can achiee is closer to what a spiritualist might do when cold reading. Understanding of statistics, no rationalisation.}

\include{_ml/includes/deep-learning-overview.md}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/ai/mechanical-elephant.jpg}{80%}

\speakernotes{So in reality what we’ve created is much more akin to a mechanical elephant. One that takes inputs and feeds back responses.}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/ai/the-hindoo-earth.jpg}{70%}

\speakernotes{Or perhaps a better analogy is that we’ve created the turtle. System Zero in the Kahneman parlance. A large data aware organ that operates at a level below our subconscious.}

\include{_ai/includes/conversation.md}

\columns{\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/Steen_Doctor_and_His_Patient.jpg}}{\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/Palazzo_San_Georgio_Genova_W.jpg}}{40%}{60%}

\speakernotes{We’ve developed institutions such as medicine and banks that ensure we understand when to trust and how to trust. Trust is critical to our mode of operation.}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/rothenburg-of-the-deaf-1624164_1920.jpg}{60%}

\speakernotes{Current approach to security is that we are either locked away or not, this does not map well to our notion of trust.}

###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/Medievalplowingwoodcut.jpg}{90%}

\speakernotes{It feels very much akin to the Medieval open field system. There are two ways in which our data I stored, either on our behalf by the “Lord of the Manor” or openly akin to the common land.}


###

\includeimg{../slides/diagrams/elephant-1065632_1920.jpg}{90%}

\speakernotes{If we could understand how to translate human notions of trust into the digital world then we would be better placed to operate with our traditional freedoms intact.}
