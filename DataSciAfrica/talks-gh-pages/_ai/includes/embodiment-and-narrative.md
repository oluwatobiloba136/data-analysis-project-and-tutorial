\speakernotes{Ernest Hemingway's apocrophal six word novel would mean nothing to a computer.}

\notes{Consider the six word novel, apocraphally credited to Ernest Hemingway, "For sale: baby shoes, never worn". To understand what that means to a human, you need a great deal of additional context. Context that is not directly accessible to a machine that has not got both the evolved and contextual understanding of our own condition to realize both the implication of the advert and what that implication means emotionally to the previous owner.}

\notes{[Fritz Heider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Heider) and [Marianne Simmel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marianne_Simmel)'s experiments with animated shapes from 1944 [@Heider:experimental44]. Our interpretation of these objects as showing motives and even emotion is a combination of our desire for narrative, a need for understanding of each other, and our ability to empathise. At one level, these are crudely drawn objects, but in another key way, the animator has communicated a story through simple facets such as their relative motions, their sizes and their actions. We apply our psychological representations to these faceless shapes in an effort to interpret their actions.}
