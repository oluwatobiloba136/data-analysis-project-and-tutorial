### Analysis of Deep GPs

- *Avoiding pathologies in very deep networks* @Duvenaud:pathologies14 show that the derivative distribution of the process becomes more *heavy tailed* as number of layers increase.

- *How Deep Are Deep Gaussian Processes?* @Dunlop:deep2017 perform a theoretical analysis possible through conditional Gaussian Markov property.
