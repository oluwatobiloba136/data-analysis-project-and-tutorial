\slides{[Information Barons threaten our Privacy](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/nov/16/information-barons-threaten-autonomy-privacy-online)}

\notes{Our current information infrastructure bears a close relation with *feudal systems* of government. In the feudal system a lord had a duty of care over his serfs and vassals, a duty to protect subjects. But in practice there was a power-asymetry. In feudal days protection was against Viking raiders, today, it is against information raiders. However, when there is an information leak, when there is a failure it is too late. Alternatively, our data is publicly shared, in an information commons. Akin to common land of the medieval village. But just as commons were subject to overgrazing and poor management, so it is that much of our data cannot be managed in this way. In particularly personal, sensitive data. 

I explored this idea further in [this Guardian Op-Ed from 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/nov/16/information-barons-threaten-autonomy-privacy-online).}
