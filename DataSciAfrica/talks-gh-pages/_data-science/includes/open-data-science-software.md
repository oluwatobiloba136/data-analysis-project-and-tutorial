\section{Open Data Science Software}

\notes{In Sheffield we have written a suite of software tools
for 'Open Data Science'. Open data science is an approach to sharing code,
models and data that should make it easier for companies, health professionals
and scientists to gain access to data science techniques. For some background on
open data science you can read [this blog post](http://inverseprobability.com/2014/07/01/open-data-science/). The first thing we will do this week is to download that suite of software. 

\notes{The software can be installed using

```python
pip install pods
```

from the command prompt where you can access your python installation.}
