### Examples

* Election polls (UK 2015 elections, EU referendum, US 2016 elections)

* Clinical trials vs personalized medicine: Obtaining statistical power where interventions are subtle. e.g. social media


### Breadth vs Depth

* Modern Measurement deals with *depth* (many subjects)
    ... or *breadth* lots of detail about subject.
	
* But what about 
    * $p\approx n$?
    * Stratification of populations: batch effects etc.

* Will summarization be devolved to the device?

* Advantages for privacy and latency.

### Also need

* More classical statistics!
    * Like the 'paperless office'

* A better characterization of human
