\notes{### Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus

We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we
will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse,
inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product
rule of probability), and the calculus of differentiation (and integration!). A
new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This
combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in
understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions.}
