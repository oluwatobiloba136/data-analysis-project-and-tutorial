title: "Outlook for AI and Machine Learning"
abstract: >
  Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the 
  current revolution in “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines and is having a 
  significant influence on the wider tech agenda.
  
  In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with machine learning solutions, and what challenges 
  we face both in the near and far future. These include practical application of existing algorithms in the 
  face of the need to explain decision making, mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data, 
  dealing with large unstructured datasets.

\notes{The aim of this presentation is give a sense of the current situation in machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as some perspective on the immediate outlook for the field.}

\notes{This presentation represents my personal opinion as an academic with 20 years experience in machine learning, computational biology and data science. This is not in any sense *Amazon* policy, but since September 2016 I have been on leave of absence at Amazon.}

### Deep Learning

* These are interpretable models: vital for disease etc.

* Modern machine learning methods are less interpretable

* Example: face recognition

### Uncertainty and Learning

* In this "vanilla" form these machines "don't know when they don't know".

* Doubt is vital in real world decision making. 

* Incorporating this in systems is a long time focus of my technical research.


### Comparison with Human Learning & Embodiment

* The emulation of intelligence does not exhibit all the meta-modelling humans perform.
