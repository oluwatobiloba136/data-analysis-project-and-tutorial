\newslide{Efficiency}
\slides{
* Economies driven by 'production'.
* Greater production comes with better efficiency.
    * E.g. moving from gathering food to settled agriculture.
* In the modern era one approach to becoming more efficient is automation of processes.
    *  E.g. manufacturing production lines
}
\newslide{Physical Processes}
\slides{
* Manufacturing processes consist of production lines and robotic automation.
* Logistics can also be decomposed into the supply chain processes.
* Efficiency can be improved by automation.
}
\newslide{Goods and Information}
\slides{
* For modern society: management of flow of goods and  information.
* Flow of information is highly automated.
* Processing of data is decomposed into stages in computer code. 
}
\newslide{Intervention}
\slides{
* For all cases:  manufacturing, logistics, data management
* Pipeline requires human intervention from an operator.
* Interventions create bottlenecks, slow the process.
* Machine learning is a key technology in automating these manual stages.
}
\newslide{Long Grass}
\slides{
* Easy to replicate interventions have already been dealt with.
* Components that still require human intervention are the knottier problems.
* Difficult decompose into stages which could then be further automated.
* These components are 'process-atoms'.
* These are the "long grass" regions of technology.
}
\newslide{Nature of Challenge}
\slides{
*  In manufacturing or logistics settings atoms are flexible manual skills.
    * Requires emulation of a human's motor skills.
* In information processing: our flexible cognitive skills.
    * Our ability to mentally process an image or some text.
