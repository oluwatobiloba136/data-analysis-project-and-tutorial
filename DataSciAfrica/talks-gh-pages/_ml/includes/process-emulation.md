\newslide{Data Driven}

\slides{
* Machine Learning: Replicate Processes through *direct use of data*.
* Aim to emulate cognitive processes through the use of data.
* Use data to provide new approaches in control and optimization that should allow for emulation of human motor skills.

\newslide{Process Emulation}

\slides{
* Key idea:  emulate the process as a mathematical function.
* Each function has a set of *parameters* which control its behavior.
* *Learning* is the process of changing these parameters to change the shape of the function
* Choice of which class of mathematical functions we use is a vital component of our *model*.
