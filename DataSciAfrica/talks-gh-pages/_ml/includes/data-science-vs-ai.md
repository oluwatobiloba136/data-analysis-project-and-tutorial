### Artificial Intelligence and Data Science

Machine learning technologies have been the driver of two related, but distinct disciplines. The first is *data science*. Data science is an emerging field that arises from the fact that we now collect so much data by happenstance, rather than by *experimental design*. Classical statistics is the science of drawing conclusions from data, and to do so statistical experiments are carefully designed. In the modern era we collect so much data that there's a desire to draw inferences directly from the data.

As well as machine learning, the field of data science draws from statistics, cloud computing, data storage (e.g. streaming data), visualization and data mining.

In contrast, artificial intelligence technologies typically focus on emulating some form of human behaviour, such as understanding an image, or some speech, or translating text from one form to another. The recent advances in artifcial intelligence have come from machine learning providing the automation. But in contrast to data science, in artifcial intelligence the data is normally collected with the specific task in mind. In this sense it has strong relations to classical statistics. 

Classically artificial intelligence worried more about *logic* and *planning* and focussed less on data driven decision making. Modern machine learning owes more to the field of *Cybernetics* [@Wiener:cybernetics48] than artificial intelligence. Related fields include *robotics*, *speech recognition*, *language understanding* and *computer vision*. 

There are strong overlaps between the fields, the wide availability of data by happenstance makes it easier to collect data for designing AI systems. These relations are coming through wide availability of sensing technologies that are interconnected by celluar networks, WiFi and the internet. This phenomenon is sometimes known as the *Internet of Things*, but this feels like a dangerous misnomer. We must never forget that we are interconnecting people, not things.
