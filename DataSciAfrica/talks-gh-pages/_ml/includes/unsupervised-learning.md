### Unsupervised Learning

* When you have data, $\inputVector$, but no labels $\dataVector$.

* Extract *structure* from data.

* Type of structure you are interested dependent on the broader context of the task.

### Context

* Supervised learning:  context is very much driven by the labels.

* Humans easily sort objects  e.g. animals and vehicles

* For large data sets or data we are not used to (high dimensional data) would like to automate.

    * E.g., an e-commerce company algorithm for sorting products into groups.

### Discrete vs Continuous

* Supervised learning is broadly divided into classification and regression

* Unsupervised learning can be split too:

1. methods that cluster the data

2. methods that represent the data as (lower dimensional) continuous values.
