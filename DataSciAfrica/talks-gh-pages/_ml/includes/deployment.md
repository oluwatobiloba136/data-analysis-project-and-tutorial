### Deployment

* Introduced almost in order of difficulty of deployment.

* Supervised learning requires more data annotation, but more straightforward to deploy.

* Therefore major focus with supervised learning should always be on maintaining data quality.

### Where to Deploy

 
> If a typical person can do a mental task with less than one second of thought, we can probably automate it using AI either now or in the near future.

### Is this Right?

* Broadly agree with this quote but only in the context of supervised learning.

* The picture with regard to unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning is more clouded. 

### Getting Easier

* We seem to be moving beyond the era where very deep machine learning expertise is required to deploy methods.

* Just require a  solid understanding of machine learning (say to Masters level)

### Streaming Data

* Supervised machine learning solutions are normally trained offline.

* They do not adapt when deployed because this makes them less verifiable.

* This compounds the brittleness of our solutions.

### Model Choice

* For  all machine learning methods is the initial choice of useful classes of functions.

* The deep learning revolution is associated with a particular class of mathematical functions.
