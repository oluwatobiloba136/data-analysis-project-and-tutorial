title: Introduction to Gaussian Processes
abstract: In this master class we will give a short introduction to Gaussian process models, and then explore their use in the domain of Bayesian
  Optimization. Gaussian process models are flexible models which
  allow us to place probability distributions over functions. In
  Bayesian Optimization, the Gaussian process is used as a surrogate
  for the process of interest. Rather than directly optimizing the
  process, the surrogate is optimized. This leads to an efficient
  approach for improving efficiency in a wide range of physical
  systems. The seminar will introduce lab classes which will make use
  of the python software GPy and GPyOpt
  (https://github.com/sheffieldml/GPy,  https://github.com/sheffieldml/GPyOpt).
  
  This first talk will be an introduction to Gaussian process models that will assume knowledge of probability, linear algebra and the multivariate Gaussian.
