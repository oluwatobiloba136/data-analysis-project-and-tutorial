abstract: In this talk we will briefly describe the Gaussian process latent variable
  model, an approach to probabilistic modelling of data through non-linear dimensional
  reduction. The model takes a dual approach to statistical inference and can be shown
  to generalise PCA. We will briefly introduce the model and quickly show some example
  applications.
