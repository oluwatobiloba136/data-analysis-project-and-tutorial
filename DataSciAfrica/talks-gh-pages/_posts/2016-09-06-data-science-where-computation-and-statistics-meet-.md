abstract: 'What is data science? An new name for something old perhaps. Nevertheless
  there is something new happening. Data is being acquired in ways that could never
  have been envisaged 100 years ago. This is presenting new challenges, and ones that
  no single field is equipped to face. In this talk we will focus on three separate
  challenges for data science: 1. Paradoxes of the Data Society, 2. Quantifying the
  Value of Data, 3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization. Each of these challenges
  has particular implications for data science and the interface between computation
  and statistics. By addressing these challenges now we can ensure that the pitfalls
  of the data driven society are overcome allowing to reap the benefits.'
