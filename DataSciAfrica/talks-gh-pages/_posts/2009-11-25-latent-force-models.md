abstract: "Physics based approaches to data modeling involve constructing an accurate
  mechanistic model of data, often based on differential equations. Machine learning
  approaches are typically data driven\u2014 perhaps through regularized function
  approximation.\\\n\\\nThese two approaches to data modeling are often seen as polar
  opposites, but in reality they are two different ends to a spectrum of approaches
  we might take.\\\n\\\nIn this talk we introduce latent force models. Latent force
  models are a new approach to data representation that model data through unknown
  forcing functions that drive differential equation models. By treating the unknown
  forcing functions with Gaussian process priors we can create probabilistic models
  that exhibit particular physical characteristics of interest, for example, in dynamical
  systems resonance and inertia. This allows us to perform a synthesis of the data
  driven and physical modeling paradigms. We will show applications of these models
  in systems biology and modelling of human motion capture data."
