abstract: "The main focus of machine learning is to combine data with assumptions
  that reflect our belief about the regularity of the world. This, then, allows us
  to generalize and make new predictions for \u2018test data\u2019. Relative to other
  modelling paradigms such as those found in physics that are based on mechanistic
  understandings of the world, models in machine learning typically make only weak
  assumptions about data.\\\n\\\nIn this talk, we argue that these weak assumptions
  are also mechanistic in nature. In particular, a very common assumption is smoothness,
  which can arise through the heat equation or other models of diffusion. Our assumption
  of smoothness reflects our belief in an underlying physical world in which smoothness
  is the norm. Strong mechanistic models, such as those used in computational fluid
  dynamics, climate etc. typically impose much more rigid constraints on the data
  and are often inappropriate for machine learning tasks where the model needs to
  be adaptive and should still perform well even when our mechanistic assumptions
  are not completely fulfilled. These strong mechanistic frameworks can, however,
  incorporate regularities beyond smoothness. Systems with inertia exhibit resonance
  and oscillation and these can be easily incorporated with strong mechanistic assumptions.\\\n\\\nWe
  believe that the area between the strong and weak mechanistic paradigms should be
  a focus for much more research. For many interesting datasets we need adaptive models
  which include mechanistic assumptions. The latent force modeling paradigm is one
  way of approaching this which relies on the combination of differential equation
  systems which are driven, or have their initial or boundary conditions set, by Gaussian
  processes. The Gaussian processes provide the necessary adaptability and the differential
  equation encodes mechanistic assumptions. In this talk we introduce the model and
  demonstrate results in motion capture date and, given time, computational biology."
