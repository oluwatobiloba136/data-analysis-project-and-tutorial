abstract: "Since the human genome project began mathematical models have become an
  integral part of biological data analysis. The growth in data availability has necessitated
  their use in summarization of the data (e.g. *statistical* approaches such as hierarchical
  clustering). Simultaneously, as more has become understood about the mechanisms
  underpinning particular pathways *mechanistic* models of interactions have become
  more widespread.\\\n\\\nThe data-driven statistical approach and the mechanistic
  model approach each have their advantages. Data-driven models can be used in genome
  wide analyses to \u2019fish\u2019 for genes that were not known to be relevant but
  provide a critical role in a pathway. Mechanistic models make real predictions about
  how systems will respond given particular interventions. The two approaches have
  interacted only loosely, often not through interaction between the \u2018mathematicians\u2019
  but through indirect interaction via the biologists.\\\n\\\nIn this talk we will
  follow describe a statistical analysis \u2018pipeline\u2019 for microarray data
  which handles the noise in the data. As we proceed down the pipeline we will come
  closer to mechanistic models of systems. We will finish with some general thoughts
  about the contribution that a combined statistical/mechanistic modelling approach
  can make."
