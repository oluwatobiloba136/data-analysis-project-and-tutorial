abstract: 'Computational biology models are often missing information, such as the
  concentration of biochemical species of interest. One approach to dealing with this
  missing information is to place a probabilistic prior over the missing data. One
  possible choice for such a prior is a Gaussian process.\

  \

  In this tutorial we will give an introduction to Gaussian processes. We will give
  simple examples of Gaussian processes in regression and interpolation. We will then
  show how Gaussian processes can be incorporated with differential equation models
  to give probabilistic models for transcription. Such models can then be used to
  rank potential targets of given transcription factors.'
