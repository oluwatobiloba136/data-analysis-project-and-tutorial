title: Approximate Inference in Deep GPs
venue: Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, U.K.
year: '2014'
published: 2014-10-23
abstract: "In this talk we will review deep Gaussian process models and relate them
  to neural network models. We will then consider the details of how variational inference
  may be performed in these models. The approach is centred on 'variational compression',
  an approach to variational inference that compresses information into an augmented
  variable space. The aim of the deep Gaussian process framework is to enable probabilistic
  learning of multi-modal data. We will therefore end by highlighting directions for
  future research and discussing application of these models in domains such as personalised
  health."
