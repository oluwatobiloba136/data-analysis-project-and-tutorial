title: 'Personalized Health: Challenges in Data Science'
abstract: >
  The promise of personalized health is driven by the wide
  availability of data, but we don't need to talk so much about where
  we want to be, rather how we should get there. What are the
  challenges that need to be bridged technologically to unlock the
  potential in the much greater availability of data we now have? In
  this talk we'll consider three challenges of data science in the
  context of personalized health, the three challenges each need to be
  bridged to bring the era of true precision, or personalized,
  medicine within the reach of an affordable health care service.
