abstract: "In this talk we will summarise recent work from our group in Manchester
  on inferring \u2018latent biochemical species\u2019 in biological systems using
  Gaussian processes and differential equations. A key problem in biological data
  is when particular biochemical species of interest are not directly measurable.
  We will show how the framework of Gaussian processes can be brought to bear on the
  problem and values of latent chemical species can be inferred given data and a differential
  equation model."
