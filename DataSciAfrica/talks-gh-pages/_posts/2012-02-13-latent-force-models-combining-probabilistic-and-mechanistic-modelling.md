abstract: 'Physics based approaches to data modeling involve constructing an accurate
  mechanistic model of data, often based on differential equations. Statistical and
  machine learning approaches are typically data driven-perhaps through regularized
  function approximation.\

  \

  These two approaches to data modeling are often seen as polar opposites, but in
  reality they are two different ends to a spectrum of approaches we might take. Physics
  based approaches can be seen as strongly mechanistic, the mechanistic assumptions
  are hard encoded into the model. Data-driven approaches do incorporate assumptions
  that might be seen as being derived from some underlying mechanism, such as smoothness.
  In this sense they are weakly mechanistic.\

  \

  In this talk we introduce latent force models. Latent force models are a new approach
  to data representation that model data through unknown forcing functions that drive
  differential equation models. By treating the unknown forcing functions with Gaussian
  process priors we can create probabilistic models that exhibit particular physical
  characteristics of interest, for example, in dynamical systems resonance and inertia.
  This allows us to perform a synthesis of the data driven and physical modeling paradigms.
  A moderately mechanistic approach. We show an application in modelling of human
  motion capture data.'
