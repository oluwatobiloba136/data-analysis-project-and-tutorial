title: The Data Science Process
abstract: In this talk we will focus on challenges in facilitating the data science pipeline. Drawing on experience from projects in computational biology, the developing world and Amazon Iâ€™ll propose different ideas for facilitating the data science process including analogies that help software engineers understand the challenges for data science and formalizations, such as data readiness levels, which allow management to reason about the obstacles in the process.
