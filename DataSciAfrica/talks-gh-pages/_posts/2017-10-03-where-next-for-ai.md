title: "Where Next for AI?" 
abstract: >
  Our current generation of artificial intelligence techniques are driven by data. But also we expect to be able to deploy artificial intelligence techniques on data. What does that mean, is it a contradiction? How will this effect the wider technology landscape? Is it simply a matter of refining deep neural nets? Or are more disruptive technologies needed? What will be the challenges of deploying AI systems?
