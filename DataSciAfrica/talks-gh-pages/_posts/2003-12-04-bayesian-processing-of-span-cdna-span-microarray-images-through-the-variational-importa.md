abstract: "Each cell in the human body contains the same basic code in the form of
  the genome, however cells have differentiated roles which come about through different
  cells \u2018expressing\u2019 different genes. Key insights into gene interactions
  can be studied through measuring the level of expression of each gene at different
  times. Gene expression levels can be obtained from cDNA microarray experiments through
  the extraction of pixel intensities from a scanned image of a slide. In this talk
  we will start by briefly reviewing cDNA microarray technology. We will then focus
  on one problem that arises when processing these images: human error in locating
  the position of the spots can lead to variabilities in the extracted expression
  levels. We will present a Bayesian approach to the image processing which alleviates
  this problem. Our approach makes use of a novel combination of importance sampling
  and variational approximations. Finally if there is time we will briefly show some
  examples of the variational importance sampler applied to visual tracking problems."
