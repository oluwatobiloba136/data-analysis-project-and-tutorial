title: Challenges and Opportunities in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
venue: ARM, Cambridge
abstract: "The current generation of machine learning technologies is powering new applications in artificial intelligence. This is presenting challenges and opportunities. In this talk we will focus on the challenge of constructing and deploying machine learning algorithms with a particular focus on two aspects: machine learning systems design and data readiness. We will also discuss implications and opportunities, with speculative thoughts on the nature of artificial intelligence in future devices and what new opportunities and challenges this may present. "
