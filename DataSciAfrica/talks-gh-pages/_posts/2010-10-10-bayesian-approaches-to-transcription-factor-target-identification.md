abstract: "A simple approach to target identification through gene expression studies
  has been to cluster the expression profiles and look for coregulated genes within
  clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic models of gene expression are typically
  constructed through differential equations. mRNA\u2019s production is taken to be
  proportional to transcription factor activity (with the proportionality given by
  the sensitivity) and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular rate. The assumption
  that coregulated genes have similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the
  decay and the sensitivity are high.\\\n\\\nIn this lecture we introduce Bayesian
  approaches to target identification which make use of sampling approaches to rank
  candidate lists of targets. We will begin with an introduction to the target identification
  problem and an overview of the power of Bayesian approaches in solving it. We will
  then consider how probabilistic models such as Gaussian processes can be used for
  ranking potential targets of a transcription factor. These models are simple enough
  to allow genome wide target identification, but rich enough to encode dynamical
  behavior that, allowing us to identify putative targets even when decay rates are
  low."
