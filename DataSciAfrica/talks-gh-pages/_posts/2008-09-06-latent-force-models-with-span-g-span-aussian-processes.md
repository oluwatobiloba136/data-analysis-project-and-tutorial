abstract: "We are used to dealing with the situation where we have a latent variable.
  Often we assume this latent variable to be independently drawn from a distribution,
  *e.g.* probabilistic PCA or factor analysis. This simplification is often extended
  for temporal data where tractable Markovian independence assumptions are used (*e.g.*
  Kalman filters or hidden Markov models).\\\n\\\nIn this talk we will consider the
  more general case where the latent variable is a forcing function in a differential
  equation model. We will show how for some simple ordinary differential equations
  the latent variable can be dealt with analytically for particular Gaussian process
  priors over the latent force. In this talk we will introduce the general framework,
  present results in systems biology and preview extensions.\\\n\\\nJoint work with
  Magnus Rattray, Mauricio \xC1lvarez, Pei Gao, Antti Honkela, David Luengo, Guido
  Sanguinetti and Michalis K. Titsias."
