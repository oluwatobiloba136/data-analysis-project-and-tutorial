abstract: "Scientific fields don\u2019t necessarily emerge because fundamental new
  knowledge is being generated, but often because a shift in the key questions that
  are facing us, and the tools that we have to answer them. The current information
  revolution is causing us to reassess our approach to data. Our mathematical and
  computational toolsets are co-evolving. The potential of very large interconnected
  data is placing urgent demands on our methodologies. In this talk, inspired by these
  challenges, I will give a personal perspective on what this means for those of us
  at the interface of Computer Science/Mathematics and Statistics. I\u2019ll attempt
  to do this not only in the context of modelling and analysis, but also in the context
  of how we deploy our conclusions for the benefit of wider society. Many of our current
  suite of methodologies were motivated by different needs, and I\u2019ll argue that
  it may now be time to return to the fundamental ideas from where these methodologies
  were inspired, but with a contemporary slant on the nature of data. My own perspective
  is that if what I describe \\*is\\* data science, then it does not stand as a field
  alone, but it represents a new and pressing set of questions that bridge the computational
  and mathematical sciences. Regardless of its phylogeny, exploring this interface
  through these questions will be mutually beneficial."
