abstract: "Physics based approaches to data modeling involve constructing an accurate
  mechanistic model of data, often based on differential equations. Machine learning
  and statistical approaches are typically data driven\u2014perhaps through regularized
  function approximation. These two approaches to data modeling are often seen as
  polar opposites, but in reality they are two different ends to a spectrum of approaches
  we might take. In this talk we introduce latent force models. Latent force models
  are a new approach to data representation that model data through unknown forcing
  functions that drive differential equation models. By treating the unknown forcing
  functions with Gaussian process priors we can create probabilistic models that exhibit
  particular physical characteristics of interest, for example, in dynamical systems
  resonance and inertia. This allows us to perform a synthesis of the data driven
  and physical modeling paradigms."
