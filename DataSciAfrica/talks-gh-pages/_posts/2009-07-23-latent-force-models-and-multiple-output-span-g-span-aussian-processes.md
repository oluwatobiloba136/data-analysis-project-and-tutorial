abstract: We are used to dealing with the situation where we have a latent variable.
  Often we assume this latent variable to be independently drawn from a distribution,
  e.g. probabilistic PCA or factor analysis. This simplification is often extended
  for temporal data where tractable Markovian independence assumptions are used (e.g.
  Kalman filters or hidden Markov models). In this talk we will consider the more
  general case where the latent variable is a forcing function in a differential equation
  model. We will show how for some simple ordinary differential equations the latent
  variable can be dealt with analytically for particular Gaussian process priors over
  the latent force. In this talk we will introduce the general framework and present
  results in systems biology and motion capture.
