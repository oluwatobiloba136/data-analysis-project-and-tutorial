abstract: In this talk we will give a brief overview of Gaussian processes and a quick
  review of how they can be applied to solve questions in computational biology. In
  particular we will show how we can construct covariance functions to solve simple
  tasks (like differential expression) or more complex tasks (like unpicking regulatory
  networks).
