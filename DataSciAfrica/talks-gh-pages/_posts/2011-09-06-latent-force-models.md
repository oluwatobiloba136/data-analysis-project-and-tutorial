abstract: "Physics based approaches to data modeling involve constructing an accurate
  mechanistic model of data, often based on differential equations. Statistical and
  machine learning approaches are typically data driven\u2014perhaps through regularized
  function approximation.\\\n\\\nThese two approaches to data modeling are often seen
  as polar opposites, but in reality they are two different ends to a spectrum of
  approaches we might take. Physics based approaches can be seen as *strongly mechanistic*,
  the mechanistic assumptions are hard encoded into the model. Data-driven approaches
  do incorporate assumptions that might be seen as being derived from some underlying
  mechanism, such as smoothness. In this sense they are *weakly mechanistic*.\\\n\\\nIn
  this talk we introduce latent force models. Latent force models are a new approach
  to data representation that model data through unknown forcing functions that drive
  differential equation models. By treating the unknown forcing functions with Gaussian
  process priors we can create probabilistic models that exhibit particular physical
  characteristics of interest, for example, in dynamical systems resonance and inertia.
  This allows us to perform a synthesis of the data driven and physical modeling paradigms.
  A *moderately mechanistic* approach. We show an application in modelling of human
  motion capture data."
