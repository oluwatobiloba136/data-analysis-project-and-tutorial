abstract: Absolute security of information locks it down and exposes it to only those
  who are granted access. Social privacy can be seen as a continuum where we expose
  different information to different parties according to levels of trust. In this
  talk we will briefly introduce our efforts on integrating privacy into learning
  algorithms to ensure a more equitable and free data society.
