abstract: "Like Hansel and Gretel\u2019s breadcrumbs into the forest we leave a data
  trail of data-crumbs wherever we go: social networks, mobile phones, hospital visits,
  credit cards and loyalty cards. Our every move is being watched! The data-crumbs
  are seeds of information but what results from them... is it a jungle with dangers
  lurking or a productive farmyard? And if our data is being farmed, where does all
  the produce go?"
