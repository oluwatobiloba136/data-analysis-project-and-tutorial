abstract: "Modern data connectivity gives us massive uncurated data sets which present
  enormous challenges for modelling and inference. I\u2019ll review where I think
  this is taking mathematics and speculate on the methodological and social challenges
  that this revolution will entail with some final reflections on how it might effect
  the teaching curriculum."
