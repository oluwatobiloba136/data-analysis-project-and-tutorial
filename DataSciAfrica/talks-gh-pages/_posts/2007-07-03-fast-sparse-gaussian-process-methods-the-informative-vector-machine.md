abstract: Gaussian processes are a non parametric approach to learning regression
  models. In this talk we will given a brief review of the use of Gaussian processes
  for regression. We will then introduce the informative vector machine approach to
  learning Gaussian processes for Classification on large scale data sets. We will
  show extensions of the method including multi-task learning, semi-supervised learning
  and learning invariances.
