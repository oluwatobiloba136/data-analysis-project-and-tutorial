abstract: "The media is full of concerns about our data and how algorithms are affecting
  us. We worry about personal information becoming public, we worry about what intelligent
  machines have in store for us. This talk will be about the state of the art in terms
  of Artificial Intelligence. It will consider what it can do and what it can\u2019t
  do. We are a long way away from implementing a \u2019sentient intelligence\u2019,
  but what do we have in its place? This talk will explore current technology and
  speculate on what futures it may lead to."
