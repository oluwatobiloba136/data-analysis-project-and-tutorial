abstract: "In November last year, deep learning algorithms made the front page of
  the New York Times. What\u2019s special about these learning \nalgorithms? What
  are they being used for and how are we using them in Sheffield? In this talk I\u2019ll
  explain what deep learning is, why \nit\u2019s considered exciting, and what the
  success stories are. I\u2019ll also explain what the problems with these learning
  systems and how we \nare trying to address these problems with our own class of
  deep architectures been developed in our group in Sheffield."
