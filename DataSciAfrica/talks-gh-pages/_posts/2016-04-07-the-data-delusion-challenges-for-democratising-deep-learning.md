abstract: 'The widespread success of deep learning in a variety of domains is being
  hailed as a new revolution in artificial intelligence. It has taken 20 years to
  go from defeating Kasparov at Chess to Lee Sedol at Go. But what have the real advances
  been across this time? The fundamental change has been in terms of data availability
  and compute availability. The underlying technology has not changed much in the
  last 20 years. So what does that mean for areas like medicine and health? Significant
  challenges remain, improving the data efficiency of these algorithms and retaining
  the balance between individual privacy and predictive power of the models. In this
  talk we will review these challenges and propose some ways forward. Bio: Neil Lawrence
  is a Professor of Machine Learning and Computational Biology at the University of
  Sheffield. His main research interest is machine learning through probabilistic
  models. He focuses on both the algorithmic side of these models and their application.
  He has a particular focus on applications in personalized health and applications
  in the developing world. He is well known for his work with Gaussian processes,
  and has proposed Gaussian process variants of many of the succesful deep learning
  architectures. He is highly active in the machine learning community, most recently
  Program Chairing the NIPS conference in 2014 and General Chairing (alongside Corinna
  Cortes) in 2015.'
