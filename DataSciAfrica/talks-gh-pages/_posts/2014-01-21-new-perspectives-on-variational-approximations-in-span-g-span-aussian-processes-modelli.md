abstract: "In this talk I\u2019ll introduce new perspectives on variational approximations.
  Many of the ideas may be widely applicable, but we will try to instantiate them
  in the context of Gaussian process models.\\\n\\\nAlthough the variational material
  itself is reasonably technical, I\u2019ll try and start the talk by making general
  statements about data modelling. Then, in an effort to make the talk seem coherent,
  I\u2019ll make claims that the technical material which follows was inspired by
  the wider perspective I\u2019ve given. Of course in practice, the technical material
  really emerged across a number of years during discussions with many people, and
  the general perspective has been retrofitted. Still, I\u2019ll be giving the talk
  amongst friends, so no one will mind too much if the story doesn\u2019t really fit
  together, and in fact it might be a good trigger for discussion. Speaking of which,
  I\u2019ll be looking forward to lots of audience participation, and such participation
  may take the talk in previously unplanned directions.\\\n\\\nThe talk will be given
  without the use of electronic aids."
