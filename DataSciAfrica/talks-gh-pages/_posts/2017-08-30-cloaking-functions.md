title: "Cloaking Functions: Differential Privacy with Gaussian Processes"
abstract: > 
  Processing of personally sensitive information should respect an individual's
  privacy. One promising framework is Differential Privacy (DP). In this talk
  I'll present work led by Michael Smith at the University of Sheffield on the
  use of cloaking functions to make Gaussian process (GP) predictions
  differentially private. Gaussian process models are flexible models with
  particular advantages in handling missing and noisy data. Our hope is that
  advances in DP for GPs will make it easier to 'learn without looking', i.e.
  gain the advantages of prediction from patient data without impinging on
  their privacy.

  Joint work with **Michael T. Smith**, Max Zwiessele and Mauricio Alvarez
