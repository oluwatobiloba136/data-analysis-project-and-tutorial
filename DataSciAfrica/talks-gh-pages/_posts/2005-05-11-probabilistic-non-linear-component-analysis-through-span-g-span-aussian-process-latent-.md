abstract: It is known that Principal Component Analysis has an underlying probabilistic
  representation based on a latent variable model. Principal component analysis (PCA)
  is recovered when the latent variables are integrated out and the parameters of
  the model are optimised by maximum likelihood. It is less well known that the dual
  approach of integrating out the parameters and optimising with respect to the latent
  variables also leads to PCA. The marginalised likelihood in this case takes the
  form of Gaussian process mappings, with linear Covariance functions, from a latent
  space to an observed space, which we refer to as a Gaussian Process Latent Variable
  Model (GPLVM). This dual probabilistic PCA is still a linear latent variable model,
  but by looking beyond the inner product kernel as a covariance function we can develop
  a non-linear probabilistic PCA. In the talk we will introduce the GPLVM and illustrate
  its application on a range of high dimensional data sets including motion capture
  data, hand written digits, a medical diagnosis data set and images.
