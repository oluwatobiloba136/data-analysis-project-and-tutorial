abstract: "A popular approach to collaborative filtering is matrix factorization.
  In this talk we consider the \u201Cprobabilistic matrix factorization\u201D and
  by taking a latent variable model perspective we show its equivalence to Bayesian
  PCA. This inspires us to consider probabilistic PCA and its non-linear extension,
  the Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) as an approach for probabilistic
  non-linear matrix factorization. We apply out approach to benchmark movie recommender
  data sets. The results show better than previous state-of-the-art performance."
