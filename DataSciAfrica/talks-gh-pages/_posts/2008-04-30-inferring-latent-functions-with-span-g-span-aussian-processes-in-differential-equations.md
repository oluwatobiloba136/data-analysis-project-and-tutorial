abstract: In this talk we will present recent work from Manchester in inference of
  latent functions in differential equations. Simple computational models for systems
  biology make use of ordinary differential equations that are driven from an often
  unobserved input function. We will describe how probabilistic inference over these
  latent functions may be performed through Gaussian process prior distributions.
  We will describe the algorithms and show results on toy problems and real biological
  systems.
