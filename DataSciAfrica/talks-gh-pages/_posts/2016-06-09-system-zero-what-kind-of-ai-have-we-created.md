abstract: "Machine learning technologies have evolved to the extent that they are
  now considered the principle underlying technology for our advances in artificial
  intelligence. Artificial intelligence is an emotive term, given the implications
  for replacing qualities that humans consider specific to ourselves. In this talk
  we\u2019ll consider what kind of artificial intelligence we\u2019ve created and
  what possible implications are for our society."
