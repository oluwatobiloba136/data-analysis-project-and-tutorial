abstract: The Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) is a recently proposed
  probabilistic approach to obtaining a reduced dimension representation of a data
  set. In this tutorial we motivate and describe the GP-LVM, giving a review of the
  model itself and some of the concepts behind it.
