abstract: "In this tutorial we will review spectral approaches to dimensionality reduction,
  introducing a unifying probabilistic perspective. Our unifying perspective is based
  on the maximum entropy principle and the resulting probabilistic models are based
  on GRFs. We will review maximum variance unfolding, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally
  linear embeddings and Isomap. Under the framework, these approaches can be divided
  into those that preserve local distances and those that don\u2019t. For two small
  data sets we show that local distance preserving methods tend to perform better.
  Finally we use the unifying framework to relate these approaches to the Gaussian
  process latent variable model."
