title: "Data Science: Time for Professionalisation?"
abstract: >
  Machine learning methods and software are becoming widely
  deployed. But how are we sharing expertise about bottlenecks and
  pain points in deploying solutions? In terms of the practice of data
  science, we seem to be at a similar point today as software
  engineering was in the early 1980s. Best practice is not widely
  understood or deployed. In this talk we will focus on two particular
  components of data science solutions: the preparation of data and
  the deployment of machine learning systems.
