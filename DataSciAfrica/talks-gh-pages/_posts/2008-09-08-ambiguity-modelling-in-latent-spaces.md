abstract: We are interested in the situation where we have two or more representations
  of an underlying phenomenon. In particular we are interested in the scenario where
  the representation are complementary. This implies that a single individual representation
  is not sufficient to fully discriminate a specific instance of the underlying phenomenon,
  it also means that each representation is an ambiguous representation of the other
  complementary spaces. In this paper we present a latent variable model capable of
  consolidating multiple complementary representations. Our method extends canonical
  correlation analysis by introducing additional latent spaces that are specific to
  the different representations, thereby explaining the full variance of the observations.
  These additional spaces, explaining representation specific variance, separately
  model the variance in a representation ambiguous to the other. We develop a spectral
  algorithm for fast computation of the embeddings and a probabilistic model (based
  on Gaussian processes) for validation and inference. The proposed model has several
  potential application areas, we demonstrate its use for multi-modal regression on
  a benchmark human pose estimation data set.
