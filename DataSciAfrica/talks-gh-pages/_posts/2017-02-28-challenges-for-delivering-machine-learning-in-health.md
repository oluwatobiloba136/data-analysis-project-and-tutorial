title: Challenges for Delivering Machine Learning in Health
venue: Deep Learning in Healthcare Summit, London
abstract: | 
  The wealth of data availability presents new opportunities
  in health but also challenges. In this talk we will focus on
  challenges for machine learning in health: 1. Paradoxes of the Data
  Society, 2. Quantifying the Value of Data, 3. Privacy, loss of
  control, marginalization. Each of these challenges has particular
  implications for machine learning. The paradoxes relate to our
  evolving relationship with data and our changing
  expectations. Quantifying value is vital for accounting for the
  influence of data in our new digital economies and issues of privacy
  and loss of control are fundamental to how our pre-existing rights
  evolve as the digital world encroaches more closely on the
  physical. One of the goals of research community should be to
  provide the technological tooling to address these challenges ensure
  that we are empowered to avoid the pitfalls of the data driven
  society, allowing us to reap the benefits of machine learning in
  applications from personalized health to health in the developing
  world.
