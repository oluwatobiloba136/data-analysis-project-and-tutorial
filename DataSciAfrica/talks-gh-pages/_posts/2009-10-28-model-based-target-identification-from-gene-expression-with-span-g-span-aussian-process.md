abstract: "A simple approach to target identification through gene expression studies
  has been to cluster the expression profiles and look for coregulated genes within
  clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic models of gene expression are typically
  constructed through differential equations. mRNA\u2019s production is taken to be
  proportional to transcription factor activity (with the proportionality given by
  the sensitivity) and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular rate. The assumption
  that coregulated genes have similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the
  decay and the sensitivity are high. In this talk we advocate model based target
  identification. We develop a simple probabilistic models of transcription (and translation)
  which encode mRNA (or Transcription Factor) production and decay. Our models are
  simple enough to allow genome wide target identification, but rich enough to encode
  dynamical behavior that, allowing us to identify putative targets even when decay
  rates are low."
