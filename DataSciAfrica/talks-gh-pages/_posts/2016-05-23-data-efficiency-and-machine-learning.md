abstract: "Entropy is a key component of information and probability, and may provide
  the key to *data efficient* learning. While we\u2019ve seen great success with the
  AlphaGo computer program and strides forward in image and speech recognition our
  current machine learning systems are incredibly data inefficient. Better understanding
  of entropy with in these systems may provide the key to data efficient learning."
