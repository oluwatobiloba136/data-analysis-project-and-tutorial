abstract: The promise of personalized health is driven by the wide availability of
  data, but we don't need to talk so much about where we want to be, rather how we
  should get there. What are the challenges that need to be bridged technologically
  to unlock the potential in the much greater availability of data we now have? In
  this talk we'll consider three challenges of data science in the context of personalized
  health, the three challenges each need to be bridged to bring the era of true precision,
  or personalized, medicine within the reach of an affordable health care service.
