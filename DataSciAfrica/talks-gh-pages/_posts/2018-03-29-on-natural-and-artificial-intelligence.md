title: "On Natural and Artificial Intelligence"
abstract: >
  *How are we making computers do the things we used to associated only with humans? Have we made a breakthrough in understanding human intelligence?*. While recent achievements might give the sense that the answer is yes, the short answer is that we are nowhere near. All weâ€™ve achieved for the moment is a breakthrough in *emulating intelligence*. In this talk we discuss two differences between the artificial intelligence we've deployed and the natural intelligence we exhibit. Resolving one is a challenge of changing the way we do systems design, the other, we argue, is a more fundamental difference that may never be overcome.
