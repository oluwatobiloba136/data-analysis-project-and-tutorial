title: "Data Analytics Perspectives: Machine Learning"
abstract: >
  In this talk we will firstly set the landscape of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science by describing what characteristics they share, and how they differ. We'll then shift focus to the promise and challenges associated with both Data Science and Artficial Intelligence, with particular attention paid to the potential for a "data crisis" and challenges in "machine learning systems design".
