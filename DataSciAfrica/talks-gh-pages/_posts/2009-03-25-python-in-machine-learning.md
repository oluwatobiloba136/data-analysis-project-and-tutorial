abstract: "Is Python a viable replacement for MATLAB?\\\n\\\nWe are incredibly reliant
  on MATLAB, but should we be looking elsewhere for our ML programming needs? In this
  ML lunch I will try and share my recent experiences with Python and machine learning:
  good and bad. The main questions I think we should be considering are:\\\n\\\nShould
  we be trying to move to Python for our research?\\\n\\\nShould we be using Python
  in our teaching?\\\n\\\nI don\u2019t know the answer, but I\u2019ll try and use
  this MLO lunch to start the debate!"
