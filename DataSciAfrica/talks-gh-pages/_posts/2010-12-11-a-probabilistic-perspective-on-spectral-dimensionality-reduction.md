abstract: Spectral approaches to dimensionality reduction typically reduce the dimensionality
  of a data set through taking the eigenvectors of a Laplacian or a similarity matrix.
  Classical multidimensional scaling also makes use of the eigenvectors of a similarity
  matrix. In this talk we introduce a maximum entropy approach to designing this similarity
  matrix. The approach is closely related to maximum variance unfolding and other
  spectral approaches such as locally linear embeddings and Laplacian eigenmaps also
  turn out to be closely related. Each method can be seen as a sparse Gaussian graphical
  model where correlations between data points (rather than across data features)
  are specified in the graph. This also suggests optimization via sparse inverse covariance
  techniques such as the graphical LASSO. The hope is that this unifying perspective
  will allow the relationships between these methods to be better understood and will
  also provide the groundwork for further research.
