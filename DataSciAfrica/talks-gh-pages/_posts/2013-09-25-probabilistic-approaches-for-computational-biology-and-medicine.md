abstract: "In this talk I\u2019ll discuss some of the challenges in personalized medicine
  and consider some of the implications for machine learning models. I\u2019ll introduce
  the probabilistic approach to machine learning, with a particular focus on Gaussian
  models. Giving some examples of applications I\u2019ll discuss Bayesian approaches
  to regression modelling and lead into Gaussian process models."
