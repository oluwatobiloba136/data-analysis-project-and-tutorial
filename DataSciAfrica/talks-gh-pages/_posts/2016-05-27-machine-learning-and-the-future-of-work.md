abstract: "Machine learning technologies have evolved to the extent that they are
  now considered the principle underlying technology for our advances in artificial
  intelligence. Artificial intelligence is an emotive term, given the implications
  for replacing qualities that humans consider specific to ourselves. As always new
  technology has a significant disruptive effect on existing markets, jobs and economies.
  In this talk we\u2019ll explore where the advances are coming from and speculate
  about how our machine learning future is likely to pan out with a particular focus
  on work."
