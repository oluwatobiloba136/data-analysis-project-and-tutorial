abstract: "What is Machine Learning? Why is it useful for us? Machine
  learning algorithms are the engines that are driving forward an
  intelligent internet. They are allowing us to uncover the causes of
  cancer and helping us understand the way the universe is put
  together. They are suggesting who your friends are on facebook,
  enabling driverless cars and causing flagging potentially fraudulent
  transactions on your credit card. To put it simply, machine learning
  is about understanding data.

  <p>In this lecture I will try and give a sense of the challenges we
  face in machine learning, with a particular focus on those that have
  inspired my research. We will look at applications of data modelling
  from the early 18th century to the present, and see how they relate
  to modern machine learning. There will be a particular focus on
  dealing with <i>uncertainty</i>: something humans are good at, but
  an area where computers have typically struggled. We will emphasize
  the role of uncertainty in data modelling and hope to persuade the
  audience that correct handling of uncertainty may be one of the keys
  to intelligent systems."
