abstract: "In the age of large streaming data it seems appropriate to revisit the
  foundations of what we think of as data modelling. In this talk I\u2019ll argue
  that traditional statistical approaches based on parametric models and i.i.d. assumptions
  are inappropriate for the type of large scale machine learning we need to do in
  the age of massive streaming data sets. I\u2019ll be arguing for flexible non-parametric
  models as the answer. This presents a particular challenge, non parametric models
  require data storage of the entire data set, which presents problems for massive,
  streaming data. I\u2019ll argue that recently proposed variational approximations
  allow us to retain the advantages of both non-parametric and parametric models within
  a consistent framework that performs an optimal compression of our data from an
  information gain perspective."
