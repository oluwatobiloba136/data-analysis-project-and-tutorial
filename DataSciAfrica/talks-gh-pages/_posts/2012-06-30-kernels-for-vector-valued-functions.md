abstract: In this talk we review kernels for vector valued functions from the perspective
  of Gaussian processes. Deriving a multiple output Gaussian process from the perspective
  of a linear dynamical system (Kalman Filter) we introduce the Intrinsic Coregionalization
  Model and the Linear Model of Coregionalization. We discuss how they relate to multi-task
  learning with GPs and the Semi Parametric Latent Factor model. Finally, we will
  introduce convolutional process models from the perspective of the latent force
  model.
