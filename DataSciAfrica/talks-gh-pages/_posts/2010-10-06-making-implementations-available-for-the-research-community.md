abstract: "Machine learning research is either inspired by a particular application,
  or by a general desire to make technology more \u201Cinteligent\u201D. In modern
  machine learning most methodological development is mathematically inspired and
  results in an algorithm for optimization or fitting of a model to data. Design choices
  in implementation of an algorithm can have a significant effect on the quality of
  results. Decisions such as model initializaiton and data pre-processing are all
  part of the implementation. Necessarily, space constraints sometimes mean that such
  details are not included in the associated paper. It seems clear that the paper
  only tells part of the story. Implementations need to be made available at the time
  of submission of the paper, so that the full story may be followed. In our research
  group we have done this since 2001. In this talk I will make the arguments in favour
  of doing this universally and give personal experiences of the results."
