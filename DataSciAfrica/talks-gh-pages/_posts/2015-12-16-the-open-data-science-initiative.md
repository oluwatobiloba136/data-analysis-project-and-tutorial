abstract: The Open Data Science Initiative is founded on the idea that there are a
  set of core principles that are restricting our ability, as a society, to exploit
  the large quantity of data we are now generating. In this talk we identify the challenges
  across the range of industry, science, health and the developing world. We then
  review the principles of open data science which we hope will address these challenges.
