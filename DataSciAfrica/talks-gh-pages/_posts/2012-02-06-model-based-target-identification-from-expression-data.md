abstract: "A simple approach to target identification through gene expression studies
  has been to cluster the expression profiles and look for coregulated genes within
  clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic models of gene expression are typically
  constructed through differential equations. mRNA\u2019s production is taken to be
  proportional to transcription factor activity (with the proportionality given by
  the sensitivity) and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular rate. The assumption
  that coregulated genes have similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the
  decay and the sensitivity are high.\\\n\\\nTypically researchers either use a data
  driven approach (such as clustering) or a model based approach (such as differential
  equations). In this talk we advocate hybrid techniques which have aspects of the
  mechanistic and data driven models. We combine simple differential equation models
  with Gaussian process priors to make probabilistic models with mechanistic underpinnings.
  We show applications in target identification from mRNA measurements."
