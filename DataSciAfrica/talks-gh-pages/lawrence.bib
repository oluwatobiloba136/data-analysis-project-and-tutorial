@string{gplvmAbstract1 = {It is known that Principal Component Analysis has an
                 underlying probabilistic representation based on a
                 latent variable model. Principal component analysis
                 (PCA) is recovered when the latent variables are
                 integrated out and the parameters of the model are
                 optimised by maximum likelihood. It is less well
                 known that the dual approach of integrating out the
                 parameters and optimising with respect to the latent
                 variables also leads to PCA. The marginalised
                 likelihood in this case takes the form of Gaussian
                 process mappings, with linear Covariance functions,
                 from a latent space to an observed space, which we
                 refer to as a Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model
                 (GPLVM). This dual probabilistic PCA is still a
                 linear latent variable model, but by looking beyond
                 the inner product kernel as a covariance function we
                 can develop a non-linear probabilistic PCA.

                 In the talk we will introduce the GPLVM and
                 illustrate its application on a range of high
                 dimensional data sets including motion capture data,
                 hand written digits, a medical diagnosis data set and
                 images.}}

  abstract =	 {Background

Transcription factors (TFs) act downstream of the major signalling pathways functioning as master regulators of cell fate. Their activity is tightly regulated at the transcriptional, post-transcriptional and post-translational level. Proteins modifying TF activity are not easily identified by experimental high-throughput methods.

Results

We developed a computational strategy, called Differential Multi-Information (DMI), to infer post-translational modulators of a transcription factor from a compendium of gene expression profiles (GEPs). DMI is built on the hypothesis that the modulator of a TF (i.e. kinase/phosphatases), when expressed in the cell, will cause the TF target genes to be co-expressed. On the contrary, when the modulator is not expressed, the TF will be inactive resulting in a loss of co-regulation across its target genes. DMI detects the occurrence of changes in target gene co-regulation for each candidate modulator, using a measure called Multi-Information. We validated the DMI approach on a compendium of 5,372 GEPs showing its predictive ability in correctly identifying kinases regulating the activity of 14 different transcription factors.

Conclusions

DMI can be used in combination with experimental approaches as high-throughput screening to efficiently improve both pathway and target discovery. An on-line web-tool enabling the user to use DMI to identify post-transcriptional modulators of a transcription factor of interest che be found at http://dmi.tigem.it.},

  abstract = {Genes with similar transcriptional activation kinetics can display very different temporal mRNA profiles because of differences in transcrip tion time, degradation rate, and RNA-processing kinetics. Recent studies have shown that a splicing-associated RNA production delay can be significant. To investigate this issue more generally, it is useful to develop methods applicable to genome-wide datasets. We introduce a joint model of transcriptional activation and mRNA accumulation that can be used for inference of transcription rate, RNA production delay, and degradation rate given data from high-throughput sequencing time course experiments. We combine a mechanistic differential equation model with a nonparametric statistical modeling approach allowing us to capture a broad range of activation kinetics, and we use Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify the uncertainty in estimates of the kinetic parameters. We apply the model to data from estrogen receptor α activation in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We use RNA polymerase II ChIP-Seq time course data to characterize transcriptional activation and mRNA-Seq time course data to quantify mature transcripts. We find that 11\% of genes with a good signal in the data display a delay of more than 20 min between completing transcription and mature mRNA production. The genes displaying these long delays are significantly more likely to be short. We also find a statistical association between high delay and late intron retention in pre-mRNA data, indicating significant splicing-associated production delays in many genes.},

  title = {The Data Delusion: Challenges for Democratising Deep Learning},
  abstract = {The widespread success of deep learning in a variety of domains is being hailed as a new revolution in artificial intelligence. It has taken 20 years to go from defeating Kasparov at Chess to Lee Sedol at Go. But what have the real advances been across this time? The fundamental change has been in terms of data availability and compute availability. The underlying technology has not changed much in the last 20 years. So what does that mean for areas like medicine and health? Significant challenges remain, improving the data efficiency of these algorithms and retaining the balance between individual privacy and predictive power of the models. In this talk we will review these challenges and propose some ways forward.

  abstract =	 {The Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) provides a flexible approach for non-linear dimensionality reduction that has been widely applied. However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximised over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a GP-LVM by maximising an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from i.i.d. observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to over-fitting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the non-linear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain or partially missing inputs. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets,
including high resolution video data.},

Our innovation in the DP model is an implementation of a new fast collapsed variational inference procedure which enables us to optimize our variational approximation significantly faster than standard VB approaches.

  OPTabstract =  {Gene transcription mediated by RNA polymerase II (pol-II) is a key step in gene expression. The dynamics of pol-II moving along the transcribed region influence the rate and timing of gene expression. In this work, we present a probabilistic model of transcription dynamics which is fitted to pol-II occupancy time course data measured using ChIP-Seq. The model can be used to estimate transcription speed and to infer the temporal pol-II activity profile at the gene promoter. Model parameters are estimated using either maximum likelihood estimation or via Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The Bayesian approach provides confidence intervals for parameter estimates and allows the use of priors that capture domain knowledge, e.g. the expected range of transcription speeds, based on previous experiments. The model describes the movement of pol-II down the gene body and can be used to identify the time of induction for transcriptionally engaged genes. By clustering the inferred promoter activity time profiles, we are able to determine which genes respond quickly to stimuli and group genes that share activity profiles and may therefore be co-regulated. We apply our methodology to biological data obtained using ChIP-seq to measure pol-II occupancy genome-wide when MCF-7 human breast cancer cells are treated with estradiol (E2). The transcription speeds we obtain agree with those obtained previously for smaller numbers of genes with the advantage that our approach can be applied genome-wide. We validate the biological significance of the pol-II promoter activity clusters by investigating cluster-specific transcription factor binding patterns and determining canonical pathway enrichment. We find that rapidly induced genes are enriched for both estrogen receptor alpha (ER) and FOXA1 binding in their proximal promoter regions.},

However, most proposed approaches only allow the exploration of the parameter space to occur sequentially. Often, it is desirable to simultaneously propose batches of parameter values to explore. This is particularly the case when large parallel processing facilities are available. These could either be computational or physical facets of the process being optimized. Batch methods, however, require the modeling of the interaction between the different evaluations in the batch, which can be expensive in complex scenarios. We investigate this issue and propose a highly effective heuristic based on an estimate of the function’s Lipschitz constant that captures the most important aspect of this interaction–local repulsion–at negligible computational overhead. A penalized acquisition function is used to collect batches of points minimizing the non-parallelizable computational effort. The resulting algorithm compares very well, in run-time, with much more elaborate alternatives.},

All these aspects obstruct the sharing and interconnection of data, and the eventual interpretation of data through machine learning or other approaches. In project reporting, a major challenge is in encapsulating these problems and enabling goals to be built around the processing of data. Project overruns can occur due to failure to account for the amount of time required to curate and collate. But to understand these failures we need to have a common language for assessing the readiness of a particular data set.

Learning is performed in a Bayesian manner through the formulation of a variational compression scheme which gives a rigorous lower bound on the log likelihood. Our Bayesian framework provides strong regularization during training, allowing the structure of the latent space to be determined efficiently and automatically. We demonstrate this by producing the first (to our knowledge) published results of learning from dozens of views, even when data is scarce.

Auto-regressive state space simulation is also recognised as a special case of semi-described learning. To achieve our goal we develop variational methods for handling semi-described inputs in GPs, and couple them with algorithms that allow for imputing the missing values while treating the uncertainty in a principled, Bayesian manner. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world data study the problems of iterative forecasting and regression/classification with missing values. The results suggest that the principled propagation of uncertainty stemming from our framework can significantly improve performance in these tasks.},

There are many likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination is more appropriate. We term these more general models ``Chained Gaussian Processes'': the transformation of the GPs to the likelihood parameters will not generally be invertible, and that implies that linearisation would only be possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e a chain. We develop an approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable and applicable to any factorized likelihood. We demonstrate the approximation on a range of likelihood functions.},

In such context, we propose a novel deep RGP model whose autoregressive states are latent, thereby performing representation and dynamical learning simultaneously. To fully exploit the Bayesian nature of the RGP model we develop the Recurrent Variational Bayes (REVARB) framework, which enables efficient inference and strong regularization through coherent propagation of uncertainty across the RGP layers and states. We also introduce a RGP extension where variational parameters are greatly reduced by being reparametrized through RNN-based sequential recognition models. We apply our model to the tasks of nonlinear system identification and human motion modeling. The promising obtained results indicate that our RGP model maintains its highly flexibility while being able to avoid overfitting and being applicable even when larger datasets are not available.},

  abstract =	 {\textbf{Background}\\\\
Time course data from microarrays and high-throughput sequencing experiments require simple, computationally efficient and powerful statistical models to extract meaningful biological signal, and for tasks such as data fusion and clustering. Existing methodologies fail to capture either the temporal or replicated nature of the experiments, and often impose constraints on the data collection process, such as regularly spaced samples, or similar sampling schema across replications.\\\\

\textbf{Results}\\\\
We propose hierarchical Gaussian processes as a general model of gene expression time-series, with application to a variety of problems. In particular, we illustrate the method's capacity for missing data imputation, data fusion and clustering.The method can impute data which is missing both systematically and at random: in a hold-out test on real data, performance is significantly better than commonly used imputation methods. The method's ability to model inter- and intra-cluster variance leads to more biologically meaningful clusters. The approach removes the necessity for evenly spaced samples, an advantage illustrated on a developmental Drosophila dataset with irregular replications.\\\\

\textbf{Conclusion}\\\\
The hierarchical Gaussian process model provides an excellent statistical basis for several gene-expression time-series tasks. It has only a few additional parameters over a regular GP, has negligible additional complexity, is easily implemented and can be integrated into several existing algorithms.

To mitigate this problem, it is common practice to pre-process the phenotypic values to make them as Gaussian as possible, for instance by applying logarithmic or other nonlinear transformations. Unfortunately, different phenotypes require different transformations, and choosing an appropriate transformation is challenging and subjective. Here we present an extension of the LMM that estimates an optimal transformation from the observed data.

                 heritable component of the transcriptional state of
                 the cell. To fully understand the genetic regulation
                 of gene expression variability, it is important to
                 study the effect of genotype in the context of
                 external factors such as alternative environmental
                 conditions. In model systems, explicit environmental
                 perturbations have been considered for this purpose,
                 allowing to directly test for environment-specific
                 genetic effects. However, such experiments are
                 limited to species that can be profiled in controlled
                 environments, hampering their use in important
                 systems such as human. Moreover, even in seemingly
                 tightly regulated experimental conditions, subtle
                 environmental perturbations cannot be ruled out, and
                 hence unknown environmental influences are
                 frequent. Here, we propose a model-based approach to
                 simultaneously infer unmeasured environmental factors
                 from gene expression profiles and use them in genetic
                 analyses, identifying environment-specific
                 associations between polymorphic loci and individual
                 gene expression traits.\\\\

                 \textbf{Results}: In extensive simulation studies, we show
                 that our method is able to accurately reconstruct
                 environmental factors and their interactions with
                 genotype in a variety of settings. We further
                 illustrate the use of our model in a real-world
                 dataset in which one environmental factor has been
                 explicitly experimentally controlled. Our method is
                 able to accurately reconstruct the true underlying
                 environmental factor even if it's not given as an
                 input, allowing to detect genuine

                 models. Deep GPs are a deep belief network based on

                 output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that
                 Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A
                 single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or
                 the GP latent variable model (GP-LVM). We perform
                 inference in the model by approximate variational
                 marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound

Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression which provides a flexible non-parametric framework for modelling periodic data. We introduce a novel decomposition of the covariance function as the sum of periodic and aperiodic kernels. This decomposition allows for the creation of sub-models which capture the periodic nature of the signal and its complement. To quantify the periodicity of the signal, we derive a periodicity ratio which reflects the uncertainty in the fitted sub-models. Although the method can be applied to many kernels, we give a special emphasis to the Matérn family, from the expression of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space inner product to the implementation of the associated periodic kernels in a Gaussian process toolkit. The proposed method is illustrated by considering the detection of periodically expressed genes in the arabidopsis genome.},

In simulation studies and analyses of real data we show that the approach, known as \manifold, outperforms previous attempts to understand the differentiation landscape.

For the former we develop a new kernel for use with binned data. For the latter we show that using inducing inputs allows us to reduce the scale of the added perturbation. We find that, for the datasets used, adding noise to a binned dataset has superior accuracy.

Studying the differences in properties of neurons that are vulnerable and resistant to the disease process in ALS may provide insights into the mechanisms of neuronal degeneration, and identify targets for therapeutic manipulation. We used microarray analysis to determine the differences in gene expression between oculomotor and spinal motor neurons, isolated by laser capture microdissection from the midbrain and spinal cord of neurologically normal human controls. We compared these to transcriptional profiles of oculomotor nuclei and spinal cord from rat and mouse, obtained from the GEO omnibus database. We show that oculomotor neurons have a distinct transcriptional profile, with significant differential expression of 1,757 named genes (q < 0.001). Differentially expressed genes are enriched for the functional categories of synaptic transmission, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, mitochondrial function, transcriptional regulation, immune system functions, and the extracellular matrix. Marked differences are seen, across the three species, in genes with a function in synaptic transmission, including several glutamate and GABA receptor subunits. Using patch clamp recording in acute spinal and brainstem slices, we show that resistant oculomotor neurons show a reduced AMPA-mediated inward calcium current, and a higher GABA-mediated chloride current, than vulnerable spinal motor neurons. The findings suggest that reduced susceptibility to excitotoxicity, mediated in part through enhanced GABAergic transmission, is an important determinant of the relative resistance of oculomotor neurons to degeneration in ALS.},

                  Complete transcriptional regulatory network
                  inference is a huge challenge because of the
                  complexity of the network and sparsity of available
                  data. One approach to make it more manageable is to
                  focus on the inference of context-speciﬁc networks
                  involving a few interacting transcription factors
                  (TFs) and all of their target genes.

                  \textbf{Results}\\\\

                  We present a computational framework for Bayesian
                  statistical inference of target genes of multiple
                  interacting TFs from high-throughput gene expression
                  time-series data. We use ordinary differential
                  equation models that describe transcription of
                  target genes taking into account combinatorial
                  regulation. The method consists of a training and a
                  prediction phase. During the training phase we infer
                  the unobserved TF protein concentrations on a
                  subnetwork of approximately known regulatory
                  structure. During the prediction phase we apply
                  Bayesian model selection on a genome-wide scale and
                  score all alternative regulatory structures for each
                  target gene. We use our methodology to identify
                  targets of ﬁve TFs regulating Drosophila
                  melanogaster mesoderm development. We ﬁnd that
                  conﬁdent predicted links between TFs and targets are
                  signiﬁcantly enriched for supporting ChIP-chip
                  binding events and annotated TF-gene
                  interations. Our method statistically signiﬁcantly
                  outperforms existing alternatives.

                  \textbf{Conclusions}\\\\

                  Our results show that it is possible to infer
                  regulatory links between multiple interacting TFs
                  and their target genes even from a single relatively
                  short time series and in presence of unmodelled
                  confounders and unreliable prior knowledge on
                  training network connectivity. Introducing data from
                  several different experimental perturbations
                  signiﬁcantly increases the accuracy.}

                 developmental programs and largely depends on the
                 binding of sequence-specific transcription factors
                 with cis-regulatory elements in the genome. Hox
                 transcription factors specify the spatial coordinates
                 of the body axis in all animals with bilateral
                 symmetry, but a detailed knowledge of their molecular
                 function in instructing cell fates is lacking. Here,
                 we used chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively
                 parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify Hoxa2
                 genomic locations in a time and space when it is
                 actively instructing embryonic development in
                 mouse. Our data reveals that Hoxa2 has large genome
                 coverage and potentially regulates thousands of
                 genes. Sequence analysis of Hoxa2-bound regions
                 identifies high occurrence of two main classes of
                 motifs, corresponding to Hox and Pbx--Hox recognition
                 sequences. Examination of the binding targets of
                 Hoxa2 faithfully captures the processes regulated by
                 Hoxa2 during embryonic development; in addition, it
                 uncovers a large cluster of potential targets
                 involved in the Wnt-signaling pathway. In vivo
                 examination of canonical Wnt--$\beta$-catenin
                 signaling reveals activity specifically in Hoxa2
                 domain of expression, and this is undetectable in
                 Hoxa2 mutant embryos. The comprehensive mapping of
                 Hoxa2-binding sites provides a framework to study Hox
                 regulatory networks in vertebrate developmental
                 processes.},

Unlike several previously proposed GP mixtures, the novel mixture has the distinct characteristic of using no gating function to determine the association of samples and mixture components. Instead, all the GPs in the mixture are global and samples are clustered following ``trajectories'' across input space. We use a non-standard variational Bayesian algorithm to efficiently recover sample labels and learn the hyperparameters. We show how multi-object tracking problems can be disambiguated and also explore the characteristics of the model in traditional regression settings.},

                 inference of transcription factor activity and
                 ranking candidate target genes from gene expression
                 time series. The underlying methodology is based on
                 Gaussian process inference on a differential equation
                 model that allows the use of short, unevenly sampled,
                 time series. The method has been designed with
                 efficient parallel implementation in mind, and the

                 additional software.\\\\

learning. From a regularization perspective they play a central role
in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the
hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion
of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a probabilistic perspec-
tive they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where
the kernel function is known as the covariance function. Traditionally,
kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problems with
scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of
work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple
outputs, motivated partially by frameworks like multitask learning. In
this monograph, we review different methods to design or learn valid
kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the
connection between probabilistic and functional methods.

                 learning, multisensor networks or structured output
                 data. From a Gaussian processes perspective, the
                 problem reduces to specifying an appropriate
                 covariance function that, whilst being positive
                 semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all
                 the data points and across all the outputs. One
                 approach to account for non-trivial correlations
                 between outputs employs convolution processes. Under
                 a latent function interpretation of the convolution
                 transform we establish dependencies between output

                 the associated computational and storage demands. In

                 different efficient approximations for dependent
                 output Gaussian processes constructed through the

  abstract =	 {{\bf Background}\\\\
The analysis of gene expression from time series underpins many biological studies. Two basic forms of analysis recur for data of this type: removing inactive (quiet) genes from the study and determining which genes are differentially expressed. Often these analysis stages are applied disregarding the fact that the data is drawn from a time series. In this paper we propose a simple model for accounting for the underlying temporal nature of the data based on a Gaussian process.\\\\

{\bf Results}\\\\
We review Gaussian process (GP) regression for estimating the continuous trajectories underlying in gene expression time-series. We present a simple approach which can be used to filter quiet genes, or for the case of time series in the form of expression ratios, quantify differential expression. We assess via ROC curves the rankings produced by our regression framework and compare them to a recently proposed hierarchical Bayesian model for the analysis of gene expression time-series (BATS). We compare on both simulated and experimental data showing that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the current state of the art.\\\\

{\bf Conclusions}\\\\
Gaussian processes offer an attractive trade-off between efficiency and usability for the analysis of micro-array time series. The Gaussian process framework offers a natural way of handling biological replicates and missing values and provides confidence intervals along the estimated curves of gene expression. Therefore, we believe Gaussian processes should be a standard tool in the analysis of gene expression time series.},

For each putative target gene we fit a simple differential equation model of transcriptional regulation, and the model likelihood serves as a score to rank targets. The expression profile of the TF is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process prior distribution that is integrated out using a nonparametric Bayesian procedure. This results in a parsimonious model with relatively few parameters that can be applied to short time series datasets without noticeable overfitting. We assess our method using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip) and loss-of-function mutant expression data for two TFs, Twist, and Mef2, controlling mesoderm development in Drosophila. Lists of top-ranked genes identified by our method are significantly enriched for genes close to bound regions identified in the ChIP-chip data and for genes that are differentially expressed in loss-of-function mutants. Targets of Twist display diverse expression profiles, and in this case a model-based approach performs significantly better than scoring based on correlation with TF expression. Our approach is found to be comparable or superior to ranking based on mutant differential expression scores. Also, we show how integrating complementary wild-type spatial expression data can further improve target ranking performance.}

These signals are conveyed onto auditory afferent nerve fibres. Neurotransmitter release at IHC ribbon synapses is controlled by L-type CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels, the biophysics of which are still unknown in native mammalian cells. We have investigated the localization and elementary properties of Ca2+ channels in immature mouse IHCs under near-physiological recording conditions. CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels at the cell pre-synaptic site co-localize with about half of the total number of ribbons present in immature IHCs. These channels activated at relatively hyperpolarized membrane potentials (about -70 mV), showed a relatively short first latency and weak inactivation, which would allow IHCs to generate and accurately encode spontaneous Ca2+ action potential activity characteristic of these immature cells. The CaV1.3 Ca2+ channels showed a very low open probability (about 0.15 at -20 mV: near the peak of an action potential). Comparison of elementary and macroscopic Ca2+ currents indicated that very few Ca2+ channels are associated with each docked vesicle at IHC ribbon synapses. Finally, we found that the open probability of Ca2+ channels, but not their opening time, was voltage dependent. This finding provides a possible correlation between presynaptic Ca2+ channel properties and the characteristic frequency/amplitude of EPSCs in auditory afferent fibres.},

                  simple models of the human body lead to
                  high-dimensional state spaces. Where the class of
                  activity is known a priori, lowdimensional activity
                  models learned from training data make possible a
                  thorough and efficient search for the best

                  of motion to be recovered, but is both difficult and

We decompose the residual variance into its components through a generalized eigenvalue problem, which we call residual component analysis (RCA). We show that canonical covariates analysis (CCA) is a special case of our algorithm and explore a range of new algorithms that arise from the framework.

From a frequentist/discriminative perspective they play a central role in regularization theory as they provide a natural choice for the hypotheses space and the regularization functional through the notion of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. From a Bayesian/generative perspective they are the key in the context of Gaussian processes, where the kernel function is also known as the covariance function. Traditionally, kernel methods have been used in supervised learning problem with scalar outputs and indeed there has been a considerable amount of work devoted to designing and learning kernels. More recently there has been an increasing interest in methods that deal with multiple outputs, motivated partly by frameworks like multitask learning. In this paper, we review different methods to design or learn valid kernel functions for multiple outputs, paying particular attention to the connection between probabilistic and functional methods.},

  abstract =	 {Meiosis is the cell division that halves the genetic component of diploid cells to form gametes or spores. To achieve this, meiotic cells undergo a radical spatial reorganisation of chromosomes. This reorganisation is a prerequisite for the pairing of parental homologous chromosomes and the reductional division, which halves the number of chromosomes in daughter cells. Of particular note is the change from a centromere clustered layout (Rabl configuration) to a telomere clustered conformation (bouquet stage). The contribution of the bouquet structure to homologous chromosome pairing is uncertain. We have developed a new in silico model to represent the chromosomes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in space, based on a worm-like chain model constrained by attachment to the nuclear envelope and clustering forces. We have asked how these constraints could influence chromosome layout, with particular regard to the juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes and potential nonallelic, ectopic, interactions. The data support the view that the bouquet may be sufficient to bring short chromosomes together, but the contribution to long chromosomes is less. We also find that persistence length is critical to how much influence the bouquet structure could have, both on pairing of homologues and avoiding contacts with heterologues. This work represents an important development in computer modeling of chromosomes, and suggests new explanations for why elucidating the functional significance of the bouquet by genetics has been so difficult.},

                  semi-definite, captures the dependencies between all
                  the data points and across all the outputs. One
                  approach to account for non-trivial correlations
                  between outputs employs convolution processes. Under

  abstract =	 {{\bf Background}\\\\ Most analyses of microarray
                  data are based on point estimates of expression
                  levels and ignore the uncertainty of such
                  estimates. By determining uncertainties from
                  Affymetrix GeneChip data and propagating these
                  uncertainties to downstream analyses it has been
                  shown that we can improve results of differential
                  expression detection, principal component analysis
                  and clustering. Previously, implementations of these
                  uncertainty propagation methods have only been
                  available as separate packages, written in different
                  languages. Previous implementations have also
                  suffered from being very costly to compute, and in
                  the case of differential expression detection, have
                  been limited in the experimental designs to which
                  they can be applied.\\\\ {\bf Results}\\\\ puma is a
                  Bioconductor package incorporating a suite of
                  analysis methods for use on Affymetrix GeneChip
                  data. puma extends the differential expression
                  detection methods of previous work from the 2-class
                  case to the multi-factorial case. puma can be used
                  to automatically create design and contrast matrices
                  for typical experimental designs, which can be used
                  both within the package itself but also in other
                  Bioconductor packages. The implementation of
                  differential expression detection methods has been
                  parallelised leading to significant decreases in
                  processing time on a range of computer
                  architectures. puma incorporates the first R
                  implementation of an uncertainty propagation version
                  of principal component analysis, and an
                  implementation of a clustering method based on
                  uncertainty propagation. All of these techniques are
                  brought together in a single, easy-to-use package
                  with clear, task-based documentation.\\\\ {\bf
                  Conclusions}\\\\ For the first time, the puma
                  package makes a suite of uncertainty propagation
                  methods available to a general audience. These
                  methods can be used to improve results from more
                  traditional analyses of microarray data. puma also
                  offers improvements in terms of scope and speed of
                  execution over previously available methods. puma is
                  recommended for anyone working with the Affymetrix
                  GeneChip platform for gene expression analysis and
                  can also be applied more generally.},

  abstract =	 {Purely data driven approaches for machine learning
                  present difficulties when data is scarce relative to
                  the complexity of the model or when the model is
                  forced to extrapolate. On the other hand, purely
                  mechanistic approaches need to identify and specify
                  all the interactions in the problem at hand (which
                  may not be feasible) and still leave the issue of
                  how to parameterize the system. In this paper, we
                  present a hybrid approach using Gaussian processes
                  and differential equations to combine data driven
                  modeling with a physical model of the system. We
                  show how different, physically-inspired, kernel
                  functions can be developed through sensible, simple,
                  mechanistic assumptions about the underlying
                  system. The versatility of our approach is
                  illustrated with three case studies from
                  computational biology, motion capture and

                  scenario where the representation are
                  complementary. This implies that a single individual
                  representation is not sufficient to fully
                  discriminate a specific instance of the underlying
                  phenomenon, it also means that each representation
                  is an ambiguous representation of the other
                  complementary spaces. In this paper we present a
                  latent variable model capable of consolidating
                  multiple complementary representations. Our method
                  extends canonical correlation analysis by
                  introducing additional latent spaces that are

                  explaining the full variance of the

                  representation specific variance, separately model
                  the variance in a representation ambiguous to the
                  other. We develop a spectral algorithm for fast
                  computation of the embeddings and a probabilistic
                  model (based on Gaussian processes) for validation
                  and inference. The proposed model has several

                  the target speech is dominant. Previous
                  computational attempts to identify such regions have
                  been source-driven, using primitive cues. This paper
                  describes a model-driven approach in which the
                  likelihood of spectro-temporal patches of a noisy
                  mixture representing speech is given by a generative
                  model. The focus is on patch size and patch
                  modelling. Small patches lead to a lack of
                  discrimination, while large patches are more likely
                  to contain contributions from other sources. A

                  species} in biochemical interaction networks is a
                  key problem in estimation of the structure and
                  parameters of the genetic, metabolic and protein
                  interaction networks that underpin all biological
                  processes. We present a framework for Bayesian
                  marginalisation of these latent chemical species
                  through Gaussian process priors.\\\\ {\bf Results:}
                  We demonstrate our general approach on three
                  different biological examples of single input
                  motifs, including both activation and repression of
                  transcription. We focus in particular on the problem
                  of inferring transcription factor activity when the
                  concentration of active protein cannot easily be
                  measured. We show how the uncertainty in the
                  inferred transcription factor activity can be
                  integrated out in order to derive a likelihood
                  function that can be used for the estimation of
                  regulatory model parameters. An advantage of our
                  approach is that we avoid the use of a
                  coarse-grained discretization of continuous-time
                  functions, which would lead to a large number of
                  additional parameters to be estimated. We develop
                  efficient exact and approximate inference schemes,
                  which are much more efficient than competing
                  sampling-based schemes and therefore provide us with

                  physical location of a mobile device from wireless
                  signal strengths, has been shown to be an accurate
                  method of indoor and outdoor localization and a
                  powerful building block for location-aware
                  applications. However, most localization techniques
                  require a training set of signal strength readings
                  labeled against a ground truth location map, which
                  is prohibitive to collect and maintain as maps grow

                  regulatory relationship between transcription
                  factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone
                  when trying to develop models of cellular
                  processes. Recent experimental high-throughput
                  techniques such as Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                  provide important information about the architecture
                  of the regulatory networks in the cell. However, it
                  is very difficult to measure the concentration
                  levels of transcription factor proteins and
                  determine their regulatory effect on gene
                  transcription. It is therefore an important
                  computational challenge to infer these quantities
                  using gene expression data and network architecture
                  data.\\\\ {\bf Results}: We develop a probabilistic
                  state space model that allows genome-wide inference
                  of both transcription factor protein concentrations
                  and their effect on the transcription rates of each
                  target gene from microarray data. We use variational
                  inference techniques to learn the model parameters
                  and perform posterior inference of protein
                  concentrations and regulatory strengths. The
                  probabilistic nature of the model also means that we
                  can associate credibility intervals to our
                  estimates, as well as providing a tool to detect
                  which binding events lead to significant
                  regulation. We demonstrate our model on artificial
                  data and on two yeast data sets in which the network
                  structure has previously been obtained using
                  Chromatine Immunoprecipitation data. Predictions
                  from our model are consistent with the underlying

                  discards potentially useful information about
                  measurement error that can be obtained from an
                  appropriate probe-level analysis. Probabilistic
                  probe-level models can be used to measure gene
                  expression and also provide a level of uncertainty
                  in this measurement. This probe-level variance
                  provides useful information which can help in the
                  identification of differentially expressed
                  genes.\\\\ {\bf Results:} We propose a Bayesian
                  method to include probe-level variances into the
                  detection of differentially expressed genes from
                  replicated experiments. A variational approximation
                  is used for effcient parameter estimation. We
                  compare this approximation with MAP and MCMC
                  parameter estimation in terms of computational
                  effciency and accuracy. The method is used to
                  calculate the probability of positive log-ratio
                  (PPLR) of expression levels between
                  conditions. Using the measurements from a recently
                  developed Affymetrix probe-level model, multi-mgMOS,
                  we test PPLR on a spike-in data set and a mouse
                  time-course data set. Results show that the
                  inclusion of probelevel measurement error improves
                  accuracy in detecting differential gene
                  expression.\\\\ {\bf Availability:} The methods
                  described in this paper have been implemented in an

                  biology have brought about the possibility of
                  directly identifying the architecture of regulatory
                  networks on a genome-wide scale. However, the
                  computational task of estimating fine-grained models
                  on a genome-wide scale is daunting. Therefore, it is
                  of great importance to be able to reliably identify
                  submodules of the network that can be effectively
                  modelled as independent subunits. In this paper we
                  present a procedure to obtain submodules of a
                  cellular network by using information from
                  gene-expression measurements. We integrate network
                  architecture data with genome-wide gene expression
                  measurements in order to determine which regulatory
                  relations are actually confirmed by the expression
                  data. We then use this information to obtain
                  non-trivial submodules of the regulatory network
                  using two distinct algorithms, a naive exhaustive
                  algorithm and a spectral algorithm based on the
                  eigendecomposition of an affinity matrix. We test
                  our method on two yeast biological data sets, using

We suggest that the fundamental difference between human and machine intelligence comes down to \emph{embodiment factors}. We define embodiment factors as the ratio between an entity's ability to communicate information vs compute information. We speculate on the role of embodiment factors in driving our own intelligence and consciousness. We briefly review dual process models of cognition and cast machine intelligence within that framework, characterising it as a dominant System Zero, which can drive behaviour through interfacing with us subconsciously. Driven by concerns about the consequence of such a system we suggest prophylactic courses of action that could be considered. Our main conclusion is that it is \emph{not} sentient intelligence we should fear but \emph{non-sentient} intelligence.},

                  is one of the most popular dimensionality reduction
                  techniques for the analysis of high-dimensional
                  datasets. However, in its standard form, it does not
                  take into account any error measures associated with
                  the data points beyond a standard spherical
                  noise. This indiscriminate nature provides one of
                  its main weaknesses when applied to biological data
                  with inherently large variability, such as
                  expression levels measured with microarrays. Methods
                  now exist for extracting credibility intervals from
                  the probe-level analysis of cDNA and oligonucleotide
                  microarray experiments. These credibility intervals
                  are gene and experiment specific, and can be
                  propagated through an appropriate probabilistic
                  downstream analysis.\\\\ {\bf Results:} We propose a
                  new model-based approach to PCA that takes into
                  account the variances associated with each gene in
                  each experiment. We develop an efficient
                  EM-algorithm to estimate the parameters of our new
                  model. The model provides significantly better
                  results than standard PCA, while remaining
                  computationally reasonable. We show how the model
                  can be used to 'denoise' a microarray dataset
                  leading to improved expression profiles and tighter
                  clustering across profiles. The probabilistic nature
                  of the model means that the correct number of
                  principal components is automatically obtained.\\\\

                  networks is computationally intractable, and so
                  there is considerable interest in developing
                  effective approximation schemes. One approach which
                  has been adopted is to bound the log likelihood
                  using a mean-field approximating distribution. While
                  this leads to a tractable algorithm, the mean field

                  solving problems of intractability in Bayesian
                  models. Unfortunately the convergence of variational
                  methods is often slow. We review a recently
                  suggested variational approach for approximate
                  inference in Gaussian process (GP) models and show
                  how convergence may be dramatically improved through
                  the use of a positive correction term to the
                  standard variational bound. We refer to the modied
                  bound as a KL-corrected bound. The KL-corrected
                  bound is a lower bound on the true likelihood, but
                  an upper bound on the original variational
                  bound. Timing comparisons between optimisation of
                  the two bounds show that optimisation of the new

                  currently the most widely used microarray
                  technology. Many summarisation methods have been
                  developed to provide gene expression levels from
                  Affymetrix probe-level data. Most of the currently
                  popular methods do not provide a measure of
                  uncertainty for the expression level of each
                  gene. The use of probabilistic models can overcome
                  this limitation. A full hierarchical Bayesian
                  approach requires the use of computationally
                  intensive MCMC methods that are impractical for
                  large data sets. An alternative computationally
                  efficient probabilistic model, mgMOS, uses Gamma
                  distributions to model specific and non-specific
                  binding with a latent variable to capture variations

                  limitations of this model are that it does not use
                  information from multiple chips and that it does not
                  account for specific binding to the mismatch (MM)
                  probes.\\\\ {\bf Results:} We extend mgMOS to model
                  the binding affinity of probe-pairs across multiple
                  chips and to capture the effect of specific binding
                  to MM probes. The new model, multi-mgMOS, provides
                  improved accuracy, as demonstrated on some
                  bench-mark data sets and a real time-course data
                  set, and is much more computationally efficient than
                  a competing hierarchical Bayesian approach that
                  requires MCMC sampling. We demonstrate how the
                  probabilistic model can be used to estimate
                  credibility intervals for expression levels and
                  their log-ratios between conditions.\\\\ {\bf
                  Availability:} Both mgMOS and the new model
                  multi-mgMOS have been implemented in an R package

                  such kernel methods represent a powerful approach to
                  the solution of many non-linear problems. However
                  kernel methods do suffer from one unfortunate
                  drawback, the Gram matrix contains m rows and
                  columns where m is the number of data-points. Many
                  operations are therefore precluded (e.g.~matrix
                  inverse $O(m^3)$) when data-sets containing more
                  than about $10^4$ points are encountered. One approach
                  to resolving these issues is to look for sparse
                  representations of the data-set A sparse
                  representation contains a reduced number of

                  space can easily be non-linearised through Gaussian

                  wireless communications are becoming increasingly

                  intelligence is the handling of
                  uncertainty. Probability theory provides a framework
                  for handling of uncertainty in a principled
                  manner. Probabilistic inference is the process of
                  reasoning under uncertainty and as such is vital for
                  both learning and decision making in probabilistic
                  models. For many models of interest this inference
                  proves to be intractable and to make progress
                  approximate methods need to be considered. This
                  thesis concerns itself with a particular
                  approximating formalism known as variational
                  inference \cite{Jordan:variational98}. Variational
                  inference has the advantage that it often provides
                  bounds on quantities of interest, such as
                  marginalised likelihoods. In this thesis we describe
                  a general framework for the implementation of the
                  variational approach. We then explore the approach
                  in several different probabilistic models including
                  undirected and directed graphs, Bayesian neural
                  networks and independent component analysis. In
                  those models which have been handled using
                  variational inference previously we show how we may
                  improve the quality of our inference engine by
                  considering more complex variational

                  obtained from microarray experiments through the
                  extraction of pixel intensities from a scanned image
                  of the slide. It is widely acknowledged that
                  variabilities can occur in expression levels
                  extracted from the same images by different users
                  with the same software packages. These
                  inconsistencies arise due to differences in the
                  refinement of the placement of the microarray
                  `grids'. We introduce a novel automated approach to
                  the refinement of grid placements that is based upon
                  the use of Bayesian inference for determining the
                  size, shape and positioning of the microarray
                  `spots', capturing uncertainty that can be passed to
                  downstream analysis.\\\\ {\bf Results:} Our
                  experiments demonstrate that variability between
                  users can be significantly reduced using the
                  approach. The automated nature of the approach also

                  factors and genes is a fundamental stepping stone
                  when trying to develop models of cellular
                  processes. This task, however, is difficult for a
                  number of reasons: transcription factors' expression
                  levels are often low and noisy, and many
                  transcription factors are post-transcriptionally
                  regulated. It is therefore useful to infer the
                  activity of the transcription factors from the
                  expression levels of their target genes.\\\\ {\bf
                  Results:} We introduce a novel probabilistic model
                  to infer transcription factor activities from
                  microarray data when the structure of the regulatory
                  network is known. The model is based on regression,
                  retaining the computational efficiency to allow
                  genome-wide investigation, but is rendered more
                  flexible by sampling regression coefficients
                  independently for each gene. This allows us to
                  determine the strength with which a transcription
                  factor regulates each of its target genes, therefore
                  providing a quantitative description of the
                  transcriptional regulatory network. The
                  probabilistic nature of the model also means that we
                  can associate credibility intervals to our estimates
                  of the activities. We demonstrate our model on two
                  yeast data sets. In both cases the network structure
                  was obtained using Chromatine Immunoprecipitation
                  data. We show how predictions from our model are
                  consistent with the underlying biology and offer
                  novel quantitative insights into the regulatory
                  structure of the yeast cell.\\\\ {\bf Availability:}

  abstract =	 {Modelling the dynamics of transcriptional processes
                  in the cell requires the knowledge of a number of
                  key biological quantities. While some of them are
                  relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates
                  and mRNA abundance levels, it is still very hard to
                  measure the active concentration levels of the
                  transcription factor proteins that drive the process
                  and the sensitivity of target genes to these
                  concentrations. In this paper we show how these
                  quantities for a given transcription factor can be
                  inferred from gene expression levels of a set of
                  known target genes. We treat the protein
                  concentration as a latent function with a Gaussian
                  Process prior, and include the sensitivities, mRNA
                  decay rates and baseline expression levels as
                  hyperparameters. We apply this procedure to a human
                  leukemia dataset, focusing on the tumour repressor
                  p53 and obtaining results in good accordance with

In a Gaussian process, the RKHS function is a mean of a posterior distribution over possible functions. Gaussian processes sustain uncertainty around this means and this leads to a posterior *covariance* function (or kernel) associated with the process. A complication for large scale Gaussian process models is the need to sustain the estimate for this covariance function. In this talk we'll review how this can be done probabilistically through a variational approach we know as 'variational compression'.

In this talk I'll argue that traditional statistical approaches based on parametric models and i.i.d. assumptions are inappropriate for the type of large scale machine learning we need to do in the age of massive streaming data sets. Particularly when we realise that regardless of the size of data we have, it pales in comparison to the data we could have. This is the domain of \emph{massively missing data}. I'll be arguing for flexible non-parametric models as the answer. This presents a particular challenge, non parametric models require data storage of the entire data set, which presents problems for massive, streaming data.

The current information revolution is causing us to reassess our approach to data. Our mathematical and computational toolsets are co-evolving. The potential of very large interconnected data is placing urgent demands on our methodologies. In this talk, inspired by these challenges, I will give a personal perspective on what this means for those of us at the interface of Computer Science/Mathematics and Statistics. I'll attempt to do this not only in the context of modelling and analysis, but also in the context of how we deploy our conclusions for the benefit of wider society. Many of our current suite of methodologies were motivated by different needs, and I'll argue that it may now be time to return to the fundamental ideas from where these methodologies were inspired, but with a contemporary slant on the nature of data. My own perspective is that if what I describe *is* data science, then it does not stand as a field alone, but it represents a new and pressing set of questions that bridge the computational and mathematical sciences. Regardless of its phylogeny, exploring this interface through these questions will be mutually beneficial.},

The current information revolution is causing us to reassess our approach to data. Our mathematical and computational toolsets are co-evolving. The potential of very large interconnected data is placing urgent demands on our methodologies. In this talk, inspired by these challenges, I will give a personal perspective on what this means for those of us at the interface of Computer Science/Mathematics and Statistics. I'll attempt to do this not only in the context of modelling and analysis, but also in the context of how we deploy our conclusions for the benefit of wider society. Many of our current suite of methodologies were motivated by different needs, and I'll argue that it may now be time to return to the fundamental ideas from where these methodologies were inspired, but with a contemporary slant on the nature of data. My own perspective is that if what I describe *is* data science, then it does not stand as a field alone, but it represents a new and pressing set of questions that bridge the computational and mathematical sciences. Regardless of its phylogeny, exploring this interface through these questions will be mutually beneficial.},

  abstract =     {Supervised deep learning techniques now dominate in terms of performance for complex classification tasks such as ImageNet. For these, the set of inputs (features) and targets (labels) are typically well defined in advance. However, for many tasks in artificial intelligence the questions that need to be answered evolve, alongside the features that we can acquire. For example, imagine we wish to infer the health status of individuals by building population scale models based on clinical data. For most people in the population most of the data will be missing because clinical tests are not applied to patients as a matter of course. Indeed, some of the features we may wish to use in our model may not even exist when our model is first designed (e.g. emerging clinical tests and treatments). We refer to this scenario as 'massively missing data'. It is a scenario humans are faced with every day. Almost all of the time we are missing almost all of the data. And yet we have no difficulty assimilating disparate pieces of information from a wide range of sources to draw inferences about our world. Implementing machine learning systems that can replicate this characteristic requires model architectures that can be adapted at 'runtime' as the data evolves, we don't want to be limited by decisions made at 'design time' when perhaps a more limited feature set existed. This poses particular challenges that we will address in this talk.},

The data is modelled as the output of a multivariate GP. The inputs to that Gaussian process are then governed by another GP. A single layer model is equivalent to a standard GP or the GP latent variable model (GPLVM). We will motivate these models by considering applications in personalized health.\\\\

We perform inference in the model by approximate variational marginalization. This results in a strict lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the model which we use for model selection (number of layers and nodes per layer). Deep belief networks are typically applied to relatively large data sets using stochastic gradient descent for optimization. Our fully Bayesian treatment allows for the application of deep models even when data is scarce. Model selection by our variational bound shows that a five layer hierarchy is justified even when modelling a digit data set containing only 150 examples. In the seminar we will briefly review dimensionality reduction via Gaussian processes, before showing how this framework can be extended to build deep models.},

  abstract =     {Spectral approaches to dimensionality reduction typically reduce the dimensionality of a data set through taking the eigenvectors of a Laplacian or a similarity matrix. Classical multidimensional scaling also makes use of the eigenvectors of a similarity matrix. In this talk we introduce a maximum entropy approach to designing this similarity matrix. The approach is closely related to maximum variance unfolding. Other spectral approaches such as locally linear embeddings and Laplacian eigenmaps also turn out to be closely related. Each method can be seen as a sparse Gaussian graphical model where correlations between data points (rather than across data features) are specified in the graph. This also suggests optimization via sparse inverse covariance techniques such as the graphical LASSO. The hope is that this unifying perspective will allow the relationships between these methods to be better understood and will also provide the groundwork for further research.},

                 within clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic
                 models of gene expression are typically constructed
                 through differential equations. mRNA’s production is
                 taken to be proportional to transcription factor
                 activity (with the proportionality given by the
                 sensitivity) and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a
                 particular rate. The assumption that coregulated
                 genes have similar profiles is equivalent to assuming
                 both the decay and the sensitivity are high.\\\\

                 Typically researchers either use a data driven
                 approach (such as clustering) or a model based
                 approach (such as differential equations). In this
                 talk we advocate hybrid techniques which have aspects
                 of the mechanistic and data driven models. We combine
                 simple differential equation models with Gaussian
                 process priors to make probabilistic models with
                 mechanistic underpinnings. We show applications in
                 target identification from mRNA measurements.}

  abstract =	 {The main focus of machine learning is to combine data with assumptions
that reflect our belief about the regularity of the world. This, then,
allows us to generalize and make new predictions for `test data'.
Relative to other modelling paradigms such as those found in physics
that are based on mechanistic understandings of the world, models in
machine learning typically make only weak assumptions about data.\\\\

In this talk, we argue that these weak assumptions are also
mechanistic in nature. In particular, a very common assumption is
smoothness, which can arise through the heat equation or other models
of diffusion. Our assumption of smoothness reflects our belief in an
underlying physical world in which smoothness is the norm. Strong
mechanistic models, such as those used in computational fluid
dynamics, climate etc. typically impose much more rigid constraints on
the data and are often inappropriate for machine learning tasks where
the model needs to be adaptive and should still perform well even when
our mechanistic assumptions are not completely fulfilled. These strong
mechanistic frameworks can, however, incorporate regularities beyond
smoothness. Systems with inertia exhibit resonance and oscillation and
these can be easily incorporated with strong mechanistic assumptions.\\\\

We believe that the area between the strong and weak mechanistic
paradigms should be a focus for much more research. For many
interesting datasets we need adaptive models which include mechanistic
assumptions. The latent force modeling paradigm is one way of
approaching this which relies on the combination of differential
equation systems which are driven, or have their initial or boundary
conditions set, by Gaussian processes. The Gaussian processes provide
the necessary adaptability and the differential equation encodes
mechanistic assumptions. In this talk we introduce the model and
demonstrate results in motion capture date and, given time,
computational biology.}

                 of gene expression are typically constructed through
                 differential equations. mRNA's production is taken to
                 be proportional to transcription factor activity
                 (with the proportionality given by the sensitivity)
                 and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular
                 rate. The assumption that coregulated genes have
                 similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the
                 decay and the sensitivity are high.\\\\

                 Typically researchers either use a data driven
                 approach (such as clustering) or a model based
                 approach (such as differential equations). In this
                 talk we advocate hybrid techniques which have aspects
                 of the mechanistic and data driven models. We combine
                 simple differential equation models with Gaussian
                 process priors to make probabilistic models with
                 mechanistic underpinnings. We show applications in

Implementations need to be made available at the time of submission of the paper, so that the full story may be followed. In our research group we have done this since 2001.

  abstract =   	 {A simple approach to target identification through gene expression studies has been to cluster the expression profiles and look for coregulated genes within clusters. Within systems biology mechanistic models of gene expression are typically constructed through differential equations. mRNA's production is taken to be proportional to transcription factor activity (with the proportionality given by the sensitivity) and the mRNA is assumed to decay at a particular rate. The assumption that coregulated genes have similar profiles is equivalent to assuming both the decay and the sensitivity are high.

Typically researchers either use a data driven approach (such as clustering) or a model based approach (such as differential equations). In this talk we advocate hybrid techniques which have aspects of the mechanistic and data driven models. We combine simple differential equation models with Gaussian process priors to make probabilistic models with mechanistic underpinnings. We show applications in target identification from mRNA measurements.}

                 conditional independencies of the
                 variables/parameters. Many of the variables are
                 unobserved. Marginalization of the unobserved
                 variables and Bayesian treatment of parameters
                 induces structure and correlations between the tasks.
                 Gaussian processes are prior distributions over
                 functions: kernel functions are the covariances
                 associated with these priors. A Gaussian process can
                 be set up to have multiple outputs. However, for
                 these outputs to have correlation between them a
                 covariance function that models correlations between
                 outputs is required. Equivalently we need to develop
                 multiple output kernel functions (also known as
                 multitask kernel functions, or structured output
                 kernels).  In this talk we will briefly review work

                 will arrive at convolutional processes through
                 physical interpretations of our models. We will try

                  extends canonical correlation analysis by

                 have become an integral part of biological data analysis.
                 The growth in data availability has necessitated their use
                 in summarization of the data (e.g. \emph{statistical}
                 approaches such as hierarchical clustering). Simultaneously,
                 as more has become understood about the mechanisms
                 underpinning particular pathways \emph{mechanistic}
                 models of interactions have become more widespread.\\\\


                 The data-driven statistical approach and the mechanistic
                 model approach each have their advantages. Data-driven models
                 can be used in genome wide analyses to 'fish' for genes that
                 were not known to be relevant but provide a critical role in
                 a pathway. Mechanistic models make real predictions about how
                 systems will respond given particular interventions. The two
                 approaches have interacted only loosely, often not through
                 interaction between the `mathematicians' but through indirect
                 interaction via the biologists. \\\\

                 biological quantities. In practice many of them are
                 difficult to measure in vivo. For example, it is very
                 hard to measure the active concentration levels of
                 the transcription factor proteins that drive the
                 process.\\\\

                 In this talk we will show how, by making use of
                 structural information about the interaction network
                 (e.g. arising form ChIP-chip data), transcription
                 factor activities can estimated using probabilistic
                 inference. We propose two different probabilistic
                 models: a simple linear model with Kalman filter
                 based dynamics for genome/transcriptome wide studies
                 and a differential equation based Gaussian process
                 model with a more physically realistic

                 relatively easy to measure, such as mRNA decay rates

                 in the form of the genome, however cells have differentiated
                 roles which come about through different cells `expressing'
                 different genes.

                 Key insights into gene interactions can be studied through
                 measuring the level of expression of each gene at different
                 times. Gene expression levels can be obtained from cDNA
                 microarray experiments through the extraction of pixel
                 intensities from a scanned image of a slide.

                 In this talk we will start by briefly reviewing cDNA
                 microarray technology. We will then focus on one
                 problem that arises when processing these images:
                 human error in locating the position of the spots can
                 lead to variabilities in the extracted expression
                 levels. We will present a Bayesian approach to the image
                 processing which alleviates this problem. Our
                 approach makes use of a novel combination of
                 importance sampling and variational approximations.

                 Finally if there is time we will briefly show some examples
                 of the variational importance sampler applied to visual

Full genotyping of patients is becoming affordable, providing information about genetic background. The phenotype of disease is becoming better characterised than ever before. Techniques such as transcriptome analysis allow a highly detailed characterization of the state of a tissue. Finally the UK government's midata initiative (and similar initiatives elsewhere) may eventually allow patients to provide information about their consumer spending habits as well as social network behaviour.\\\\

These different data modalities need to be combined into one model of the patients well being. There are major challenges with doing this: models need to be applied across millions of patients and for any given patient many information modalities will be missing. Addressing data of this type requires new machine learning methodologies. This project will focus on combining data from different modalities within the same probabilistic model.}

The constraint could be that the hands of the player touch the hands of the character giving the object. With the current approach to animation (looking up a library of motion capture data) such a constraint is very difficult to fulfill as the required motion won't exactly match a sequence in the library. By modelling natural motion through machine learning, we should be able to generate a new sequence to satisfy the constraint.\\\\

The models of motion will be developed using Gaussian processes. In particular the project will make use of the "Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model" (Lawrence, 2003) which has already shown a lot of promise in this domain, and "Latent Force Models" (Alvarez et al, 2009) a recently developed approach to learning based on physics and probabilistic models. \\\\

The project will involve a large amount of mathematics, in particular advanced linear algebra and calculus.}

  abstract = {Models of biological systems, such as gene networks, are useful in
extracting meaning from quantitative data obtained from specific biological systems. In this PhD proposal we are interested in how things actually work in real observable biological systems. To do this we will make use of machine learning to infer mechanistic models biological systems. \\\\

Biological systems are immensely complex, and extracting all the data necessary to characterize the system is often impossible. It is therefore important to exploit other sources of information when modelling biological systems. Once such source of information is "mechanistic models". These are models of the underlying physical properties of the system. In this project we will ensure that such physical models can be easily combined with data driven machine learning approaches, aiming to obtain the best of both worlds: mechanistic modelling and data driven machine learning models. \\\\

  title = {Inferring Complex Hidden Causes of Disease through Probabilistic Models},
  abstract = {The increased ability to measure individuals' genetic profiles ( through single nucleotide polymorphisms), combined with the ability to characterize a disease activity through gene expression, and other biomarkers, should reveal more realistically complex webs of causal factors for disease. Understanding these causal factors would enable personalised interventions targeted to an individual's genetic, environmental (including concurrent treatments) and treatment preference profile. \\\\

This vision is challenging on two fronts: first, integration of different sources of (genomic) biological data is not straightforward; second, environments are not artificially controlled. In practice, disease occurrence and progression is often triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Environmental factors need to be assimilated with the genetic background (through the genomic data) and placed in a unified modelling framework to characterize the disease. \\\\

The objective of this project is to address these issues. Our aim is to perform statistical inference from these models to enable us to resolve the determinants of a given disease and its responses to treatments. The research will involve amalgamation of several different research areas, covering health, biology, computational and statistical inference. \\\\

In this project (in collaboration with a start up company) we will consider how machine learning can be used to balance the need of the individual for privacy agains the need of society to be able to validate identity. Our aim is to build distributed user indenity validation systems that do not require the user to reveal personal information. We will do this by designing intelligent, machine learning based, agents that validate a user's information locally on the telephone. The project may involve collaboration with a London based start up company operating in this area.

By combining an anemometer, a power meter and an understanding of the rider's kinetic and gravitational potential energy the power loss due to aerodynamic drag can be estimated. Software for the project will be written according to the principles of open data science.
